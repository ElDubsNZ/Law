                    Whereas by an Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales and its dependencies made and passed in the fourth year of the reign of Her present Majesty, intituled <ref citation="4 Vic 7" jurisdiction="NSW">"An Act to empower the Governor of New South Wales to appoint Commissioners with certain powers to examine and report on Claims to Grants of Land in New Zealand,"</ref> after reciting that in various parts of the Islands of New Zealand comprehended within the limits of the Territory and Government of New South Wales tracts or portions of land were claimed to be held by various individuals by virtue of purchases or pretended purchases gifts or pretended gifts conveyances or pretended conveyances or other titles, either mediately or immediately from the chiefs or other individuals of the aboriginal tribes inhabiting the same, and reciting that no such individual or individuals could acquire a legal title to or permanent interest in any such tracts or portions of land by virtue of any gift purchase or conveyance by or from the chiefs or other individuals of such aboriginal tribes as aforesaid, and also reciting that Her Majesty had by instructions under the hand of one of Her Majesty’s Principal Secretaries of State, dated the {{date|1839-08-14|fourteenth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine}}, declared Her Royal will and pleasure not to recognize any titles to land in New Zealand which did not proceed from or were not or should not be allowed by Her Majesty, and after stating that it was expedient and proper to put beyond doubt the invalidity of all titles to land within the said Islands of New Zealand founded upon such purchases or pretended purchases gifts or pretended gifts conveyances or pretended<page></page> conveyances or other titles from the same uncivilized tribes or aboriginal inhabitants of New Zealand, it was therefore in and by the said now reciting Act declared and enacted that all titles to land in New Zealand which were not or might not thereafter be allowed by Her Majesty were and should be absolutely null and void; and the said now reciting Act then authorizes and empowers the said Governor of New South Wales to issue one or more commission or commissions and thereby to appoint Commissioners who should have full power and authority to hear examine and report on all claims to grants of land in New Zealand, with certain other powers and provisions in the said Act contained: And whereas the said Governor of New South Wales, under and by virtue of the said Act, did issue his commission bearing date under the Seal of the said Colony of New South Wales the {{date|1840-09-30|thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty}}, thereby appointing certain Commissioners with power to hear examine and report on all claims to grants of land in New Zealand. And the said Commissioners appointed therein did proceed to hear and examine certain of such claims but have not as yet reported thereon, and other of the like claims have lately been referred to the said Commissioners by the said Governor of New South Wales: And whereas, since the appointment of the said Commissioners, the Islands of New Zealand have been separated from the Government of New South Wales and erected into a Colony by Her Majesty’s Royal Charter, and it is therefore expedient and necessary that the said Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales and its dependencies should be repealed and the said Commission so issued by the said Governor thereof determined: And whereas it is expedient and proper that a local Ordinance for the same general purposes, intended to be provided for by the said in part recited Act of the Governor and Council of New South Wales, together with such other enactments applicable to the altered circumstances of the Colony of New Zealand, should be enacted by the Governor and Legislative Council of the same:
