# Public Notice

By order of Colonel William Wakefield, President of the Council, acting under the authority of the Sovereign Chiefs of the District of Port Nicholson.

Whereas, by Articles the first and thirteenth, of the Agreement signed by the majority of the Colonists before leaving England, and to which th eforce of law hath been given by Sanction and Ratification of the Sovereign Chiefs of this District, it is provided:—

1st.— That all the persons parties to this Agreement, shall submit themselves to be mustered and drilled under the directions of persons to be appointed as hereinafter mentioned. And

13th.— That the Company's Principal Agent shall have the highest authority in directing the armed inhabitants, when called out; and that the Committe shall have the power to appoint such other persons as they think fit to assist in such direction.

Notice is hereby given, that measures will be immediately taken for carrying into effect the foregoing Articles of Agreement, and that all the male inhabtants of the District, between the ages of eighteen and sixty, will be henceforward required to hold themselves in eradiness to be mustered and drilled under the direction of the President of the Council.

As it is intended to occupy no more than one hour in each week in this muster of the armed inhabitants, the object of which is to assure the minds of all persons of the existence of an adequate force for the preservation of of order, it is believed that all who feel interested in the protection of life and property, as well as in upholding the power and authority of the British race, will make it a point of honor to attend and answer to their names, when called upon the muster-roll, with such arms as they may be in the possession of: and it is expected that the employers will make no deduction from the wages of those employed by them, for the small portion of time that may be taken from the day's labour for the discharge of an important public duty.

By the order of the President of the Council,
SAMUEL REVANS, Secretary.
