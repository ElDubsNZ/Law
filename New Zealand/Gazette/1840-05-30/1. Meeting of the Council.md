# Saturday, May 23, 1840.

Owing to the stormy weather on the 16th, there was not a quorum, and the Council adjourned.

On the 23rd, several motions were entered, and a discussion arose on the mode of employing those who should be sentenced to hard labour. It was urged that it would be well to use such labour for a particular purpose— public improvement of some kind. It was considered that there are two public works, which ought to be completed as soon as possible, and which it might be well to have done by prison labour;— making a road from the bend of the valley to Thorndon, by which both sides of the harbour would then have a good land communication; and cutting the canal which is to be formed in the town, upon a scale sufficient to admit a large class of boats, but the discussion did not result in any determination.

A letter from Mr. Robert Tod, lately from Australia, was then read.

The Secretary was ordered to prepare a reply, to the effect that the members of the Council had not the knowledge which he asserted they possessed; and that his conduct did not entitle any unsupported charges he might make to the slightest degree of credit.

The Council then adjourned.
