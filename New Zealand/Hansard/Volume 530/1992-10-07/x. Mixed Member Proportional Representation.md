# MIXED MEMBER PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.

## Introduction

JIM ANDERTON (Sydenham): I move, That leave be given to introduce the Mixed Member Proportional Representation Referendum Bill. The Bill provides for a second referendum to the one that was held on 19 September, to be held on Saturday, 27 March 1993, and that if on that occasion there is an affirmative result for the MMP (mixed-member proportional representation) system against the present first-past-the-post system, that result would be implemented for the 1993 general election.
