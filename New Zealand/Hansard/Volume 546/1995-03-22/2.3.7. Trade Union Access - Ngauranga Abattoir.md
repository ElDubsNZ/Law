### Trade Union Access---Ngauranga Abattoir

15. **STEVE MAHAREY (Palmerston North) to the Minister of Labour:** In the light of the difficulties that a Meat Union organiser had in gaining access to members at the Ngauranga abattoir recently, will he take steps to ensure that employers are better informed about rights of access for union representatives; if not, why not?

**Hon. DOUG KIDD (Minister of Labour) replied:** The labour inspectorate of the Department of Labour already undertakes a range of activities to provide employees and employers with information on their employment rights and obligations. This includes information on statutory rights of access for representatives of employees' organisations to workplaces. The labour inspectorate operates a nationwide freephone telephone number: 0800 800 863. The inspectorate also provides, free of charge, a number of publications setting out employment rights and obligations.
