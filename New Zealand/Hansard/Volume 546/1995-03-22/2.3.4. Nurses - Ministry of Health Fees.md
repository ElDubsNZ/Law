### Nurses---Ministry of Health Fees

12. **JOY McLAUCHLAN (Western Hutt)** to the **Minister of Health:** Are nurse practitioners still required to pay a fee for Ministry of Health therapeutic notes and prescriber updates in order to cover the costs of free distribution to prescribers and pharmacies?

**Hon. JENNY SHIPLEY (Minister of Health) replied:** No, after the introduction of a subscription fee system, it came to the Ministry's attention that a group of practice nurses had been sent a subscription notice. The notice was withdrawn immediately.
