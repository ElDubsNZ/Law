### Electricity Prices---Wairoa Power

11. **JANET MACKEY (Gisborne)** to the **Minister for Senior Citizens:** Given his statement that "This substantial increase [of Wairoa Power's line charges] will be of particular concern to consumers who are on low incomes and use small amounts of domestic power", will he give an assurance to the Wairoa chapter of Grey Power that he will support their request of the Minister of Energy for him to use his powers under the Electricity Act 1992 to achieve a reduction in fixed charges to consumers in Wairoa; if not, why not?

**Hon. PETER GRESHAM (Minister for Senior Citizens) replied:** As Minister for Senior Citizens I am kept informed about a wide range of issues of interest and concern to older people. In this role I maintain regular dialogue with my Ministerial colleagues on these issues as they relate to their portfolios. In my letter of reply to the concerns of the Wairoa chapter of Grey Power on the recent increase of Wairoa Power line charges, I expressed my concern that the excessive use of fixed charges increases the total power charges for customers such as superannuitants who use small amounts of electricity. The Minister of Energy is well aware of my concerns in this area.
