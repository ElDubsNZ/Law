### Motor Vehicles---Retail Prices

16. **Hon ROB STOREY (Waikato) to the Minister of Commerce:** What reports, if any, has he received indicating that the real retail price of cars is going down?

**Hon. PHILIP BURDON (Minister of Commerce) replied:** I have not received any reports on this matter. If the honourable member would like me to find out what information is available I would be happy to do that. It may, however, be extremely difficult to get information on the "real" retail prices. I understand that there are published list prices, but that individual dealers do actively compete on prices and that offered prices can also vary depending on the particular car and type of customer. Issues like trade-in values can also be relevant.
