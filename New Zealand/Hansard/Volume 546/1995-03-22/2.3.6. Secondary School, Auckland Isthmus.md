### Secondary School, Auckland Isthmus

14. **CHRIS FLETCHER (Eden)** to the **Minister of Education:** Does his ministry intend to announce a decision on whether a new secondary school is required on the Auckland isthmus; if so, when?

**Hon. Dr LOCKWOOD SMITH (Minister of Education) replied:** A report on updated demographic projections for secondary age students on the Auckland isthmus is scheduled for completion by 31 March 1995. Before making a decision I propose to consult with local secondary school boards of trustees on the conclusions of the report.
