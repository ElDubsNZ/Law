### ECNZ Split

9. **ELIZABETH TENNET (Island Bay) to the Prime Minister:** Will he intervene to stop any plans to split the Electricity Corporation; if not, why not?

**Rt Hon. J B BOLGER (Prime Minister) replied:** As I said before in answer to questions, the Government has yet to make firm decisions on the structure of ECNZ. We are considering a range of options, including the possibility of competing State-owned enterprises. Privatisation is not an option on the table. The issue to be addressed is straightforward: our growing, competitive economy will need additional sources of electricity over the next 10 years and beyond. We need to meet those energy needs at the lowest costs on the economy as a whole, consistent with sustainable development.
