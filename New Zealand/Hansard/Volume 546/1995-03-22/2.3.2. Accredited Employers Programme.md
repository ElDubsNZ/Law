### Accredited Employers Programme

10. **BRIAN NEESON (Waitakere)** to the **Minister for Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance:** What feedback, if any, has he received from the Accredited Employers Programme?

**Hon. BRUCE CLIFFE (Minister for Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance) replied:** Of the 11 companies who completed the pilot scheme last year, nine have made formal application to join the Accredited Employers Programme. These nine companies employ approximately 9,000 employees. The corporation has also received requests for briefing material about the programme from a further 150 companies. I am very pleased with this response. Accredited employers will receive a payment to accept full liability for their employees' work-related injuries of less than 12 months' duration. It must be stressed that these employers will provide this service strictly within the terms of the corporation's legislation and review processes.
