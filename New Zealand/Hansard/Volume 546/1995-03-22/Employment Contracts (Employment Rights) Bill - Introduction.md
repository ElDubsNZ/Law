# EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS) BILL
## Introduction

**JIM ANDERTON (Sydenham):** I move, That leave be given to introduce the Employment Contracts (Employment Rights) Bill. I want to deal with some of the defects in the present Employment Contracts Act and the response that I think this Parliament should make to them, and I hope my colleague the member for Auckland Central will be able to deal with some of the detailed clauses in the Bill at a later date.

There are some fundamental defects in the current Employment Contracts Act. It is based on the myth of employer-employee equality, which, of course, does not exist in the real world. In most situations, conditions of employment are mainly---and often entirely---determined by employers, with no genuine process. Employers present workers with contracts---usually individual but sometimes misnamed collective---and require workers to accept them. Sometimes this is done with overt pressure, such as threatening to deny people promotion, transfer, or wage increases. The Act fails to promote collective bargaining and therefore breaches the conventions of the ILO. The ILO renewed its criticism of the Employment Contracts Act on this point in its final report on the complaint laid by the Council of Trade Unions.

The Employment Contracts Act provides escape routes to employers from collective bargaining. Employers are not required to bargain collectively with their own staff to enter multi-employer contracts or even to bargain in good faith. The basic civil rights of an employee in the workplace are not protected, access by union representatives is still under attack, and employers try to avoid dealing with authorised representatives of workers.

The Alliance policy is for a full review of industrial relations legislation with the aim of putting in place a law that encourages collective bargaining, guarantees workers basic rights in the workplace, and puts in place a fair pay-fixing system. This Bill does not do all those things but it does address the worst aspects of the Employment Contracts Act that we have at present. It contains a series of amendments to the Employment Contracts Act rather than being a complete replacement for it. In that sense it is a realistic Bill drafted with the composition of the present Parliament in mind.

It should be possible for this Parliament to accept this Bill. We believe that the Bill reflects the majority of public opinion better than the Employment Contracts Act does in its unmodified and seriously defective present form. If passed, this Bill would make a real and immediate difference to the workplace situation of many thousands of workers. People would see Parliament working for them rather than merely entrenching the power of those who are already strong. The Bill reflects the criticisms that have been made of the Act by the ILO and it reinforces the direction of recent court decisions, which have tended to soften some of the worst effects of the Employment Contracts Act. But we should not allow the courts to have to do this, nor should we wait for them to do it; this Parliament should do it.

I want to give some examples to those members who may not realise how serious the effect of the Employment Contracts Act is in the workplace at the present time. I visited Romanos Pizza Co. late last year and the employer is still refusing to negotiate a collective contract, even though the employees want one. In 1994 the union sought and got an interim injunction preventing the employer from going behind the union's back. The employer now recognises the union, but only its acting for each worker individually. It will not accept collective negotiations or a collective contract. The union argues that settling a contract for one worker affects the possible outcome for others who are also union members so that they have to negotiate collectively.

Pay rates at Romanos range from $6.50 an hour, which is $300 a week, less tax, to the highest rates of pay, $8.25 to $8.50, which is $330 to $340 a week, less tax. The hours of work are not guaranteed. There are a certain number of weekly hours, but there is no daily predictability whatever. Under the contract that workers are required to sign, they can be required to work 12 hours on one day, and 2 hours the next day. Some workers have been sacked for working only 8 hours on a given day. The substantive argument arising from the interim injunction that was granted by the court is yet to be heard. But the union will be seeking an instruction for the employer to negotiate collectively and in good faith, which he refuses to do.

I mention the Taylor Preston meat processing plant. This is a large site in the Ngauranga Gorge. It has 600 staff, and it runs four shifts 7 days a week. It is run, according to union representatives, like the Paremoremo prison. Management watch the workers via closed-circuit television. Workers are filmed and timed when talking to the union. The delegate has been banned from using the phone to ring the union. The union has about 200 members and it has sought to meet with them on the site. Union organiser Ken Findlay was arrested recently for entering the slaughter board. The company is trying to confine union officials to designated meeting-rooms. This will be tested shortly at a hearing of the Employment Court. This action clearly appears to be in breach of the Employment Court's decision on rights of access in the Southern Pacific Hotels case.

The New Zealand Educational Institute has reported that the Government is attempting to put principals, assistant principals, and deputy principals on to individual employment contracts, even though most of them want collective contracts. The Government is trying to foster a management culture offering, through the State Services Commission, more money to those who accept individual contracts. It is 5 percent this year and 5 percent next year subject to performance evaluation, 
compared with the 2 percent this year plus the $600 payment offered to those principals who will not accept an individual contract.

Kindergarten teachers are losing the ability to have a national contract. Some individual kindergartens are opting not to join a national collective contract. The issues are pay rates, no rise in wages for kindergarten teachers for 4 years, working alongside untrained staff, attempts to reduce holidays, and the lengthening of working-hours by making the teaching sessions longer. These rights are denied by the Act---the right of workers to choose to be in a collective contract and the right of workers to pursue a multiple-employer contract.

Churtonleigh Retirement Home was picketed by the Service Workers Union just before Christmas last year. The employer agreed to collective bargaining but refused a collective contract. It refused to consider pay rates paid by similar homes, it made a take it or leave it offer, and it then refused to negotiate. Staff were rung up at home by the principal nurse, who offered pay increases to some people and threatened others with a loss in shifts. No pay offer was made to the union delegate until March 1995. Workers were left with no legal remedy other than strike action. Some have now signed individual contracts, and $250 was paid to selected staff members for signing an individual contract. The pay rate there is $8.60 an hour. There are no weekend penal rates. The unions sought $9 an hour, which is 40c above that. Other homes, which do not pay penal rates, pay an hourly rate of about $9.50.

In February this year McDonald's, which has had a collective contract since the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act, announced that it was no longer interested in collective contracts. It had received advice from a company called Teesdale Meuli, who are industrial law advisers. Over a 3-week period McDonald's held crew meetings around the country to explain the new system. The union was not admitted to these meetings. Terms of employment were to be incorporated into company policy with an annual review of pay. No opportunity for negotiation was to be made over terms of employment. In effect the whole of McDonald's workforce is now on individual contracts, and that is 5,000 staff. This was all done despite the union being authorised to act as the bargaining agent for members of the union working for McDonald's. The company has bypassed the bargaining agent. That is clearly against the Employment Contracts Act.

These things need to be dealt with by this Parliament rather than by court actions just stacking up against employers who want to exploit working people.

In March 1995 workers at Pizza Hut were offered a take it or leave it package of a 1.33 percent pay increase, with a further 2 percent increase in December of this year, plus youth rates. There will be no union fee deductions. In the new Delta outlets there will be no collective contract. No negotiations were permitted. The offer was made directly to the staff, even those who were union members.

The decisions of the Employment Court are starting to extend the right of workers, but these decisions are being resisted by some employers. This is the role of Parliament; it is not the role of courts. The legislation coming from this Parliament should be clear. It seems to me that the Government has promised delivery under the Employment Contracts Act, which has clearly been breached in reality.

Qantas Airways has refused to negotiate on the existing collective contract. Staff have been presented with a new contract containing cuts, removal of penal rates, and the lengthening of a standard working week from 37 hours to 40 hours. People who are seeking transfers, promotions, or new jobs have been told that acceptance of the new contract is a condition of getting those transfers or different positions.

The ILO has said to the Government and the country that the Employment Contracts Act does not promote collective bargaining, as international labour law requires. On the basis of evidence presented to it, the ILO committee concluded: "A significant number of collective bargaining problems have arisen and continue to arise in practice from the point of view of compliance with ILO principles on freedom of association." The Government claimed that that report was a vindication of its Employment Contracts Act. I would hate to be around when the committee was being critical of it. The ILO committee said that "Bargaining should be in good faith." It said that " Employers should not try to bypass the authorised representatives of working people."

It called for the repeal of section 63(e) in the Employment Contracts Act. This is the provision banning industrial action in support of multi-employer agreements. It called for tripartite talks over the future of industrial legislation. Of course, such talks have not occurred.

The provisions in our Bill are along the lines sought by the ILO.

**Mr Max Bradford:** Rubbish!

**JIM ANDERTON:** The member says "Rubbish." What the member does not know about banking is only compounded by what he does not know about industrial relations. The provisions in our Bill are along the lines sought by the ILO. The House should be aware that if it votes against this Bill, it is not just thumbing its nose at the ILO. I know that some members on that side, by what they have said, hold that organisation in contempt. Recently, at the social summit in Copenhagen, this Government brought New Zealand into disrepute by trying to get removed from any discussion the labour provisions under the Employment Contracts Act.

If this Act is allowed to continue it will bring industrial relations in this country into international disrepute. New Zealand will be seen clearly by the international community to be not upholding justice for working people. It is about time that some of the issues, which are happening in the real world under this Employment Contracts Act, were addressed by this House.

There are serious injustices. Even if the Government claims that the benefits of the so-called recovery are out there for all to see and feel, the truth is that the Employment Contracts Act has provided a mechanism by which ordinary working people can be refused access to the fruits of that recovery. In fact, their conditions and pay can be worsened at a time of economic recovery.

**Steve Maharey:** So-called.

**JIM ANDERTON:** So-called recovery. The reality is that people are earning less money and are working harder under worse conditions. By the Government turning its mind from that reality, it is refusing to face the circumstances that so many of the citizens it claims to be representing are now facing.

I appeal to members of the Government, who proclaim from time to time their concern about social justice and about the ordinary needs of working people, to make a contribution to this Parliament as a representative body by voting for the introduction of this Bill. It needs to get into a select committee so that people like myself and others can hear evidence from people at the coalface about what is really happening in industrial relations and about working conditions, so that we can get a humane, sensitive, and compassionate set of industrial laws that will again start to make New Zealand the kind of country and society that people can be proud of and that working people can see they have a just right to belong to. That is the challenge to Parliament tonight.

**Hon. DOUG KIDD (Minister of Labour):** This is the second effort in a few months to knock over the Employment Contracts Act. The last one was defeated. At least after we have disposed of this one we will have peace for another year.

The honourable member introducing the Bill pointed to a number of cases that would be found by most reasonable people to be at the margin, if not excessive. Then he said something that really is the key to this debate---he quoted cases from the Employment Court about people who are persisting to act against the Act. Changing the Act does not make much difference to people already acting against it. One is always reminded of that very wise injunction to people dealing with the law, that hard cases make bad law. Reaction to them, when remedies are available, as appeared to be acknowledged, suggests we are involved in an exercise in futility in which members of Parliament believe that if only more laws are passed and more money is spent, everything will be solved. We had a generation of that and we only just escaped alive from it.

Over the last period since the Employment Contracts Act came into force, opponents of it, including Opposition members, said that the end of the world was nigh and that all sorts of terrible things were going to happen. The truth is that as the months have gone by, the Government's assertions at the time the Bill was introduced that it did support freedom of association, it did provide an adequate basis for collective bargaining, and so on, have been borne out and affirmed by the courts. This Government, in the time that I have been Minister, has acknowledged its acceptance and that it is comfortable with those decisions. The law was interpreted according to the policy intention of the Government at the time. All sorts of foul motives were attributed to the Government at the time the Bill was introduced.

The law has been enacted, the courts have confirmed the intent, and now we see that---surprise, surprise---we have some people who will try to get round every law, and do, and that the solution is more changes to the law. Rigorous enforcement of the law is appropriate, and a very considerable part of the resources of the Department of Labour for which I am responsible are expended in providing free support to employees. It is most interesting that the Employment Contracts Act---for the first time, I think, in the employment history of this country---allows everybody access to forums to deal with their complaints, issues, or grievances. The measures for which the member for Sydenham went into the lobby for his previous parties, and for which all members opposite or their predecessors went into the lobby, denied remedies for up to half of all New Zealanders.

**Sandra Lee:** That's nonsense.

**Hon. DOUG KIDD:** That is not nonsense. One had to be a member of a privileged group of New Zealanders to have any rights at all; to hell with the rest, they were non-persons! "Non-persons", of course, is a concept known to socialists and their near kin---they rewrite history books, and people disappear. So they were comfortable with up to half of the workforce being non-persons. They had no rights before the law. Where is the rule of law? No, they did not believe in that! It was sectional, prejudicial legislation. This National Government has provided one law for everyone for the first time in our history. And people are using it with alacrity, and effectively. Consistently the outcomes reinforce the policy intention of the Employment Contracts Act.

A number of provisions in this Bill seek to rewrite the law in an amateur attempt to give expression in the statutes to what the courts have said the Act means. There is no more certain way to start another round of litigation and to raise uncertainty and doubt than to rewrite statutes. In a number of areas we are seeing critical rights of employees being affirmed by the courts, and Parliament through the member for Sydenham is being asked to rewrite the law so that we can have another 
couple of years in which to find out whether they expressed the court's view of the law. That does not commend itself to me as a useful exercise in which Parliament should engage itself. If that is the only thing they want to bring before the House, we should dismiss it.

There are two fundamental issues in this Bill on which this Government has very strong positions. One issue is in relation to the right to strike about social and economic matters---in other words, political strikes. We have taken the view consistently that no employers ought reasonably to have to suffer loss of business in relation to a matter over which they have no control at all---no fault, no responsibility, only injury to the business, and of course ultimately jobs are also put in jeopardy. When exports cannot be delivered just in time in a highly competitive world, we cannot ring up any more and say: sorry that we cannot get them away tomorrow, we are having a strike because the staff do not like what the Government is doing about something totally unrelated to business. The business is gone and further crunching is necessary on employees.

Some people opposite find that slightly amusing. But since we last had laws that allowed that sort of thing the world has opened up and become competitive, one might say a bit ruthless, but the reality is we have to make our way in the world, like it or not, and we cannot close up shop for several days at a time to have a go at the Government. For goodness' sake, join a party. Both the Labour Party and the Alliance need members badly; they have hardly got any. There is an outlet for people who are opposed to the Government. They should not put their own jobs and their business's competitive position in the market at risk when it has nothing whatsoever to do with their employer.

There is also the question of multi-employer contracts. In an open competitive economy---and that is the only way we will get ahead---one cannot say to firm A: "You have got to sit down with your arch-
competitor, firm B, and negotiate an agreement with people in the particular type of, say, trade skill." If that sort of thing comes back, then we are looking at a complete reversal of the broad economic policy direction. There is no point in having a Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act---which I think at least the Labour Party still supports, although we wait week by week to see how long it stays with it, I might add---and there is no point in the economic policy setting that has brought the growth, the recovery that we have seen, because one starts attacking the very fundamentals of it.

So these last two matters I have raised are issues that go to the whole direction of the country and have to be resisted on that ground alone; indeed, it needs no other grounds.

The fact that this economy has recovered so that it is able to produce 75,000 additional jobs in the 1994 year is not an accident. [Interruption] Here is another of Labour's consistently persisted-in myths. They are untruths, and if one only has recourse to the household labour force survey---

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The Minister is not entitled to say that any party has perpetuated untruths. I ask him to withdraw.

**Hon. DOUG KIDD:** I withdraw. The household labour force survey---the authoritative view on matters relating to employment and so on---shows conclusively that the overwhelming majority of jobs created are full time. The Labour Party persists in denying the independent statistical evidence, and the repetition of its myths and its incorrect understanding of simple data will not make it go its way. The reality is that we have a soundly based employment-yielding recovery and we will not have the prospects of more New Zealanders getting jobs put at risk by sending out signals to show that everything is open for a rewrite back in the direction of the bad old days that took us down. That is where we draw the line and that is why we oppose this legislation.

**STEVE MAHAREY (Palmerston North):** The Labour Opposition will be voting in favour of this Bill going to a select committee. Opposition members believe that this Bill ought to be debated in the select committee, and ought to have the opportunity for these issues to be thrashed about. Government members might well like to listen this evening, because this is the second time they have had the opportunity to spend reflecting on legislation---now hear this---that will change. It will change. There is absolutely no doubt that the march of history will say that legislation that has no social justice at its centre will go. That is the challenge tonight. Check the ideology at the door. Come in here, sit down, say: "We had better grab the opportunity while we can, to think through this legislation again."

I want to signal one major reservation we have in relation to this Bill.

**Sandra Lee:** Here we go.

**STEVE MAHAREY:** The member should listen for a while and not be so cynical about the whole process. When we put up our Bill, reservations were made by the former leader of the Alliance and we will make some now. The major reservation is that we have piecemeal legislation---a series of clauses put together that attack bits and pieces of the Employment Contracts Act. It is a modification of what is going on. It does not attack root and branch the legislation that must be scrapped and new legislation put in. That is our policy.

**Mr Max Bradford:** Does the member want to repeal the Act?

**STEVE MAHAREY:** The member for Tarawera might like to listen. He does not really listen very often, but Labour Party policy is "scrap and replace". I say to members opposite and to the Alliance so that they understand why we want to do it in that way, that the long title of this Bill is the key to what it is about. The long title states that the Employment Contracts Act is about efficient labour markets. Let me tell members on the other side and those who have done a little bit of history---as the member for St Kilda on this side has---that this legislation is unique in the Western civilised world. Why is it unique? It is unique because it departs utterly from what labour relations legislation is about. It is about trying to ensure a just and equitable relationship between the two parties in the workplace. We have here the absolute opposite. That is why we are a curiosity. That is why people travel across the world to come to visit us. It is not to pat us on the back, it is to say: "What the hell are you doing down here?".

Everybody else in the civilised world runs their industrial relations on the basis of a just and fair relationship between workers, their representatives, and employers and their representatives, and we do not do that. That is what is curious about us. That is why this Bill has to go, from the first word to the last word. It is wrong in concept and in practice and that is why we will repeal it and replace it with fair legislation. That is why I tell the Alliance that we will support the passage of this Bill to a select committee, but we have major reservations about passing legislation that has not been broadened to take out the whole Employment Contracts Act. Hopefully, when the Bill gets to the select committee the Government will say: "Let's have a look at the whole thing." We hope that sense will prevail and that the Government will come across.

If this Bill, which is so wrong in concept, so wrong in practice, stays in place, it has to be seen as part of an unfinished agenda by members like the member for Tarawera. What does the Government have planned if we carry on down this line? Do not believe for a minute that this is the end of the story, people. Think back to when this Bill came in. Remember that short figure, Ruth Richardson, who is outside the House now. Remember what she wanted. She wanted total deregulation of the labour market. Think about things like the Holidays Act for a moment. Why has it taken the Government 4 years to not review that Act? The reason is quite simple.

**Alec Neill:** It's always on holiday.

**STEVE MAHAREY:** That is quite right, as the member says, but the main reason is that the Holidays Act guarantees basic rights to working people. The Employment Contracts Act runs exactly in opposition to that. It deregulates those rights. It puts them up for negotiation and trading off. If the people of this country leave this Government in place, running its line of thinking, running its legislation, we will see Acts such as the Holidays Act come up for negotiation in the same way as everything else does, so that employees will have to say to their employer: "Well, I'd like to have Christmas this year, but when can I have it?". That is the logic of what is going on here. Members on the other side may look a little puzzled about this, but they should ask themselves why it has taken 4 years. The answer is that the Government is trying to find a way to start deregulating those basic rights as well.

This whole Act is wrong for workers. It is wrong for this country. It strips workers of their rights. It places them in an unfair position---and I want to come back to a point later on---it is bad for our economy. Let us go through some of the things about workers. We have heard some stories tonight; we need to hear more. There is a reality out there, and no fuzzy stories about exceptional cases, in which people are treated properly, denies the fact that we have a pact.

I heard the Minister say earlier "Well, the member for Sydenham has raised some exceptional cases here. They're at the margins." What about the polytechs? Are we at the margins when we talk about polytechs? These are Government owned. These people are Government servants. These are people who are not allowed collective contracts. They voted for them. They asked their unions to represent them. They say that a collective contract is their preferred way of behaving, but are they allowed it? Absolutely not! At the centre they are told "No way, it is individual contracts or nothing." Is that at the margins? Is that exceptional? Is that something that does not happen often? The member for Tarawera knows that that has been an ongoing dispute right across this country, and we still have a polytechnic at which there has been no settlement because the workers are holding out for a collective contract. Why can they not have a collective contract? The workers voted for it and that is what they want. That is what the union is asking for.

I tell that member, who will no doubt get up and say that this is an exception, that time after time after time at polytechs the union has not been recognised. I know that the union does not exist in the Act. I know that we are not allowed to talk about trade unions as far as the Government is concerned. It took them out of the legislation. It does not mention them. They are not even there any more, but employers are supposed to talk to the representative of the workers. In this case the members on the other side have to come to terms with the fact that in the very core of our education system workers can ask for their trade union representatives to be talked to, and they are not. Collective contracts are denied them. It is unfair.

Let us take the case of the young worker, for example, the 17-year-old who is supposed to go into this employment environment, to sit down and say to someone like the member for Tarawera "I am here for a job and now I want to negotiate my contract. I want a decent hourly rate, I also want to negotiate my training contract, I want to be able to work that out."

My youngest child has been employed over the last little while; other members' family members may well have been employed, too. They would know that even articulate young people who have a lot of confidence find it impossible to go into an employer and say "I do not like this employment contract, I will have something else for myself. Let us start trading this off.", because the employer will simply say "This guy's a little stroppy, this young man is a little stroppy, we won't hire him." They 
won't make it to the short list. Is that not what happens? This is unfair. These young people are not protected. Have wages gone up? The architect of the Employment Contract Act promised that it would deliver money for workers, but real disposable income has gone down. The member who was the architect of the Bill says that it does not worry him, because some people are getting richer, some people get a whole lot more money.

The member who will get to his feet later on said in the House the other night that he was one of the beneficiaries of this change in the environment. No doubt he is, but the average working family has had a cut in its salary. Our public servants have had 5 years of productivity with no change in the money that they earn. Is that sharing it? Is that fair? Is that what we were told this Act would bring? It is not. It is bad for business. I could not believe it when I heard the member over there say that his vision of our economy was of individual firms competing all on their own out there in the world market-place. What a ridiculous vision of a successful economy in the global market-place!

Co-operation is the key, co-operation is what this party stands for, and co-operation is what we will encourage amongst people so that they co-operate at home and compete abroad. That is what we want. That is what an open global market-place is about. It is not about people in this country cutting each other's throats, trampling over each other, and undercutting each other so that they can be in a position to go out on their own and compete in the market-place out there. That is a ridiculous vision of where we should be going, but that is the vision we have had. The meatworks are full of it. Our industries are full of it.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD (Tarawera):** What a pathetic speech! It was about as pathetic as the last speech we heard from that member when he tried to bring a Bill into the House, not to get rid of the Employment Contracts Act but to set up a committee to look at whether we should throw out the Employment Contracts Act. That was pathetic beyond belief. The fact that the Labour Party has to piggy-back on an Alliance Bill must make Labour members absolutely choke.

I want to touch on a number of points tonight because this Bill is absolute rubbish. It reminds me of a speech made by the member for Sydenham in the House last night when he demonstrated---

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The member cannot refer to a speech made last night.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** All right. The member shows about as much knowledge of this area as he has shown of banking on previous occasions. He is a disgrace to the House---that is what he is.

I pick up one point mentioned by the member for Palmerston North. He said the Employment Contracts Act has done nothing but deregulate the rights of workers.

**Steve Maharey:** That's happening.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** Yes, I freely admit we have done that. What we have done is give every working New Zealander the right to choose whether he or she belongs to a union. If life was left to the Labour Party or to the Alliance, one would still have to join unions compulsorily before being able to get a job. Is that bad deregulation? It has got to be good for working people.

The Employment Contracts Act deregulated one wrong in the Labour Government legislation. Personal grievance rights were given to every New Zealander in the workforce. Those rights were not available when the Labour Party or the Alliance was in power---well, the Alliance never has been and never will be in power, but it is at least thinking about it. Labour never gave New Zealanders personal grievance rights. The only rights workers had were if they were members of a union and were covered 
by an award; then maybe they had personal grievance rights. If that is what deregulation of the labour market means, then I am all for it---and I bet a dollar to a doughnut most New Zealanders are.

The members on the other side of the House say the right to bargain collectively has been removed. What absolute nonsense! The name "union" sure is not in the Act but the right to collective bargaining still is, and 85 percent of New Zealanders who are covered by collective agreements are represented by trade unions. What is wrong with that? Members on the other side of the House, whether they be in the Alliance or the Labour Party, have lost sight of the real world. They do not get their feet dirty in the workplaces of this world. They sit in this House, pretending they know what is happening throughout the world. They are a disgrace to their people.

This Bill is a trade union Bill, and all the noise we are hearing from the other side of the House tonight is from at least seven of the 14 trade unionists.

**Steve Maharey:** I'm a trade unionist?

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** Yes. This Bill delivers rights and power back to trade unions. That is what it is all about. This country has moved beyond that. Fourteen trade unionists sit on the other side of the House. There may be more now. This Bill is for them. This Bill is their pay-off to the union bosses.

**Jim Anderton:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is out---[Interruption]

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The point of order will be heard in silence. I have to hear the matter the member raises or I cannot make a ruling.

**Jim Anderton:** It is out of order for any member to suggest that members of the House are in the pay or under the influence of anyone else who is promoting legislation or doing anything else in this House. That is what the member has clearly indicated. He should withdraw that accusation.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** If the member did use that term I ask him to withdraw and continue.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** Speaking to the point of order, Mr Speaker, I point out that the term I used was "pay-off". That is not quite the same thing as the member is saying.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** I think the member knows that at the very least that term is provocative. It will lead to disorder. I would be grateful if he would withdraw.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** How could I resist a request like that? I withdraw, Mr Speaker. I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that last year the member who has just resumed his seat introduced a Bill in an attempt to create a committee to decide whether the House should get rid of the Employment Contracts Act. That Bill failed.

**Trevor Mallard:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I think you have already ruled on this matter previously and have told this member he cannot refer to a previous Bill in the same session.

**John Carter:** It was last year.

**Trevor Mallard:** It was last year but the same session. Therefore I suggest that you bring him back to order again.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The Standing Order the member raised in his point of order refers to reference to a debate in the same calendar year. The member for Tarawera is in order.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** The point is not lost.

**Steve Maharey:** What point?

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** The point is that the member knows very well that the last time he tried to do this---whenever it was; I forget---he failed.

**Hon. Dr Michael Cullen:** So?

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** It is going to happen again tonight, I can assure members opposite. I cast my mind back to the debate in 1991---God only knows, I hope I am inside the Standing Orders when I do this---when the original Employment Contracts Bill was introduced. Some of the statements made by members opposite make delightful reading. Let me just quote one or two things.

In Hansard, Volume 514, at page 1440 the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Albert, said: "The Minister of Labour has set a test for the success of this Bill that it can never meet, because he described the Bill as the panacea to solve the country's economic problems. He called it a trigger of a more creative and flexible economy." The member then said: "What excuse will the Government give to the electorate in 2 1/2 years' time"---that is about now---"when the panacea has not delivered the results the Minister has prescribed for it?".

The simple fact is that it has been delivered. Members opposite are denying reality. Jobs have gone up since the Act has been in place. How many new jobs have been created?

**Hon. Roger McClay:** How many? One hundred thousand?

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** There have been 126,000 new jobs created. Members opposite want to deny reality. Another point she made was: "The Bill has far-reaching consequences for New Zealand's industrial environment. I believe that is a recipe for anarchy"---

**Jim Anderton:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The member was talking about the "member for Albert", and that "he" said this; now it is "she".

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** That is not a point of order. That matter can be corrected in following speeches in the debate.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** I appreciate the member getting up and trying to derail my speech, because he cannot be enjoying this.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** Too many loud interjections are coming mainly from members who are not sitting in their own seats.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** The then Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to say "I believe that is a recipe for anarchy at the workplace level." What did she say? She said it was a recipe for anarchy at the workplace level. What has happened in the meantime?

**Dianne Yates:** That's right, anarchy.

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** Oh anarchy! How do we measure that? How do members opposite tell whether there is anarchy in the workplace? I suggest they have a good, hard look at the work stoppage figures. In the last year of the Labour Government, under legislation Labour would have this House pass again, 331,000 days were lost through work stoppages.

**Larry Sutherland:** How many would the Government have saved?

**Mr MAX BRADFORD:** Let me tell the member opposite that the figure is now 24,000. If that is industrial anarchy then I am all for it.

I have another quotation from the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition: "Many employees will be subjected to harsh and oppressive individual contracts, and their chances of enforcing the rights in law will be very few." Labour members have got that wrong again. The member over there would have us, with this Bill he wants to introduce, play with personal grievance procedures.

The member for Sydenham is prescribing a death by a thousand cuts for a piece of legislation that unfortunately for Opposition members is working, and unfortunately for them is doing precisely the opposite of what they said. I think they will find that the country does not agree with them. They say they oppose the Employment Contracts Act for four basic reasons, the first being that it signals a future for New Zealand industrial relations that is foreign to New Zealand. That is absolute rubbish. How else could we produce a situation in which jobs are up, incomes are up, and work stoppages are down?

**RICK BARKER (Hastings):** The previous speech reminded me of the death throes of a floundering fish, lashing---

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The member will not use language like that. I warn him right from the word go that it is disorderly. The member may continue.

**RICK BARKER:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Which word did you find was out of order?

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** Floundering fish. If the member continues using that type of language, which will lead to disorder in the House, in my view he will breach the Standing Orders. He will not be allowed to do it.

**Jim Anderton:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I point out that in the speech made by the member for Tarawera he called me and, I think, other members of the House a disgrace.

**Mr Max Bradford:** That's true.

**Jim Anderton:** He says it is true. He is confirming it now. It seems to me that if a member can be vigorous enough to call other members a disgrace to the House, then calling that member a floundering fish is rather mild.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The member is trifling with the Chair. I have ruled---
[Interruption] If the member for Palmerston North wants to remain in the Chamber he shall maintain silence when I am on my feet. I have ruled that the term "floundering fish" is out of order. If it continues I will have to use the Standing Orders. I do not want to. I think the member can make a perfectly good speech in respect of this debate without that type of language.

**Trevor Mallard:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am merely going to ask you to make clearer your ruling. When asked, you said you were ruling out "floundering fish". Can a member use those words individually rather than together---that is, can a member say that another member is floundering? It is relatively important, because if a member cannot say that---and members have been saying it for many years in this House---I think it is a new ruling. It is precedent setting, and I would be quite concerned about it.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** I am not going to rule out of order a whole series of words that someone might or might not use in the future. I have ruled out of order, in the context of tonight's debate, the words the member used. What someone might do in the future would depend on the context in which the words were used.

**Trevor Mallard:** You are setting a precedent for the Chair.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** I know I am. I will set another one in a moment, too.

**RICK BARKER:** Mr Speaker, you have stolen a bit of my thunder. It is difficult to start. I have often said that Parliament is sometimes pure theatre, but I would have to say that the recent discussion has been a little like something by Monty Python. However, the point I want to make is that the member for Tarawera tried to attack, but it was like being assaulted with a wet bus ticket. His speech had no substance, lots of rhetoric, and no facts at all. All he relied upon was extreme language.

Yes, he did say the Act is working. It was the only thing he said that had some semblance of truth in it. The Act is working, and it is working as designed. It was designed to cut the pay of those who are the most vulnerable. It was designed to strip away from workers their wages and conditions. The day after the Employment Contracts Act was passed, a senior employer rang me and said: "Penalty rates for Christmas Day have gone." That is what he said, because he knew that the Act gave him and his organisation the very power to cut away those penalty rates. That was despite the assurances given by the then Minister of Labour that penalty rates and overtime rates would not be cut.

That Minister is a slippery customer. What he said about the Employment Contracts Act when it came in was that it was not intended to produce antisocial behaviour. He said that the Act was not prescriptive, and when things go wrong he acts like a bewildered innocent: "Oh woe is me." He says the Act is entirely permissive---whatever happens should have happened. Let us examine that for a moment on the issue of partial lockouts, which is dealt with in this Bill.

Partial lockouts were never envisaged in the way they were used in the Society for the Intellectually Handicapped (IHC) case. When the IHC case came out the then Minister of Labour said that must be what the Act was designed for. Some time later that decision was overturned, and what did we hear then? The new Minister of Labour said: "That's what it should have been all the time." These people want to have their cake and eat it too. They will say anything at all to try to hide the ugly truth.

The ugly truth is that if one walks around the streets of New Zealand, household after household will say that one of the greatest issues that confronts people is the Employment Contracts Act, because they are worried about their jobs. People feel that their job security has gone down. The Teesdale Meuli survey done by this Government to show what was good about the Employment Contracts Act turned out to be a disaster because the majority of workers said they feel less secure in their employment now than they did before. Job security has gone down.

People are worried about the next contract negotiations. They are fearful of what the boss is going to chop off them next time. The penalty rates have gone, allowances have gone, and so on. The Minister of Youth Affairs can shake his head as he wings his way around the country in business class, and so on. He will never mix with ordinary working people who have to go out and graft day after day, dollar after dollar, to try to help feed and clothe their families. To them every dollar counts. It is not for him to mix with those people.

Those people are very fearful about the future because the Employment Contracts Act shifts the power from workers to the employer. The Employment Contracts Act enables employers to conscript workers to join their collective contracts. "You sign here or there is no job." It does not matter whether the person comes in the door looking for a job or is in employment. Thousands of workers in New Zealand are being told: "If you don't sign this contract there is no job." That is what the Employment Contracts Act is about---conscription.

The Act is anti collective bargaining. The member for Sydenham mentioned numerous examples of that. The Employment Contracts Act has a predisposition to individual employment contracts, and the longer the Act stays in, the more individual contracts we will have. The bosses know well the old maxim of "divide and conquer". They know that if they have workers on individual contracts they can 
negotiate with them individually, and they can play one group off against another. They do not want workers to be organised, collectivised, and able to speak with one voice---not one whit. Of course they do not.

The ILO has condemned the Employment Contracts Act on that basis, and it was correct to condemn it. I went to the ILO some years ago just as the Employment Contracts Act was being introduced. I spoke to the German delegation; to the Government officials, the representatives of the workers---
the unions---and the employers. They asked me what was going on in New Zealand, and what the Employment Contracts Act was about. I described the Act to them in the most dispassionate terms possible. It was very difficult but I did.

The first question the Germans asked me was simply this: "Why does your Government hate its people so?". I was thunderstruck. They had seen through the Employment Contracts Act so quickly and so easily. That Act is extreme by any measure. Even workers in the Philippines have more protection than what the Employment Contracts Act gives New Zealand workers. The Philippines recognises and promotes collective bargaining. If workers vote for collective bargaining they have to have it.

Members should go and talk to the polytechnic tutors, and to the young doctors in Invercargill, who wanted a collective contract. Those people are not at the fringes; they are at the centre---if one wants to use that phrase---of the New Zealand labour market. Those people wanted a collective employment contract and the employer denied them it. The then Minister of Labour told people they were entitled to have a collective contract, but the truth is workers can seek but they will never find if the boss decides to take it off them. Let us be clear about that. Collective contracts are given only if the employer says people are entitled to them. There is no right to a collective contract. The workers in this country should be entitled to workplace collective contracts, and they will get them eventually.

In respect of the Employment Contracts (Employment Rights) Bill moved by the member for Sydenham, I support the overall thrust of the Bill. I support many, many things in it, but I have one subtle reservation. The problem for me is that the Employment Contracts Act accepted the Holy Grail of the Employers Federation, and on one night---15 May 1991---a National Party Government deregistered every union in this country with one swipe. Members will not see the word "union" written on the statute book of this Parliament. There is not one mention of the word "union". I say in this House that "union" is not a dirty word. "Union" is a proud word. "Union" is a word that represents the collective will of working people---[Interruption]

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** The Minister of Maori Affairs used a term that was totally unparliamentary. I ask him to withdraw it.

**Hon. John Luxton:** I am happy to withdraw it.

**RICK BARKER:** My major difficulty with this Bill is that it buys into the language of the Employment Contracts Act. I want to see legislation in this House that recognises unions, says they are proud, says they can stand tall in this country, says they have rights. That is what I want to see. I want to see legislation that says that when workers join unions, automatically that union has the right to represent them, and says that the union is not separated from the workers. That is a myth perpetuated by Tories. They say unions are different from workers, when it is not true. When workers join unions they join them so that the union can represent them. They join them to be one and the same.

Eventually this House will come to its senses. Eventually this phase of madness will pass. I want to underscore the words used by the member for Palmerston North: "The Employment Contracts Act 
will go." It is past its "use by" date. It is hanging on like grim death, and it will go. It is only a matter of time. The tide is sweeping against it. The Employment Contracts Act will go, and I will be proud to be in the House when it does go.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY (Minister of Youth Affairs):** I am interested particularly in the comments made just towards the end of that speech---a good speech, might I say, for its cause---in respect of the place of unions in relation to workers. I was interested in the comment made by a young worker in the Northland area when he spoke to the chairman of the Labour Committee and his colleagues. He said: "The good thing about the Employment Contracts Act is that it has recognised the unseen third party-
--the worker." That is what that young man thought.

This is a good debate tonight because it is almost like the good old days when one knew which party was on which side of these particular issues. The member who has introduced the Bill tonight is a member whom I would have expected to introduce such a measure, given his background and his commitment to the labour movement. This measure, of course, seeks to redress what he perceives as deficiencies in protection for employees, especially in the areas of contracts generally and in what one might call good-faith bargaining.

But this is really another mechanism of the "Green, Mana Motuhake - led NewLabour Alliance Party", which was aided and abetted by its being on the news tonight that it was being introduced. This is its big tilt towards the trade union movement in the hope of getting back to the good old days when there was unswerving support by unionists for the loony left of the political spectrum.

The members of that party are well qualified to tilt for that vote and that support. They represent the most loony of left in the current political spectrum of New Zealand. I have to say that to their shame, members of the Labour Opposition have stood up tonight and said---and will continue to say: "And us too." Labour Opposition members really do want to get that compulsory levy money back. They are too lazy to collect it---to knock on doors. They want to get that compulsory money, even from National Party members in the union, so that it can go in their coffers to help them to teach people how to get on the roll---whether it is a day or a month before the election, but I will not get on to that matter.

That is why it is part of Labour's strategy and it is the same reason that the members opposite dumped their last leader. That is why they have distanced themselves from the man they once knighted. Do members remember the name of the man the Labour Government knighted? It was Sir Roger Douglas.

The workers of New Zealand really are not stupid. They look at the policies, they look at the progress that has been made in their country, and they make up their own minds. They do not want or seek the sorts of changes contained in this Bill. They certainly do not go along with a commitment made by the Labour Party, which gets shaky as elections approach, to get rid of this particular legislation altogether.

There is no doubt that amongst the many ingredients in New Zealand's current economic and social recovery---and it comes in that order---can be found the Employment Contracts Act. I want to say to Labour Opposition members right now that they really cannot have it both ways. On the one hand many of them claim to have been part of our economic recovery whilst on the other hand they seek to shun some parts of that same recovery; they cannot have it both ways. We remember that they shunned their past president, the member who introduced this Bill, and pushed him off to form a new party---the NewLabour Party. They now embrace him in this loopy dismissal of one of the most strategic and meaningful routes to our current increasing prosperity.

So Labour Opposition members are most confused. Tonight they decided they would support this legislation and embrace their past leader and support his contentions. They have to make up their minds; either they welcome that past Labour Party member back into their party with open arms---of course with the baggage that he would have to bring from the Mana Motuhake - Alliance leadership-
--or they will have to try---

**Sandra Lee:** I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. During the course of the member's speech he has used the word "loopy" and he has now referred to "baggage". Does that fall into the same category as "floundering fish" in your book?

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** I have been listening very carefully. [Interruption] I do not need any help from the member who is sitting there bellowing the answer to me, when she has asked me a question. I will give the answer. The member, to whom I was listening very carefully, was not applying those words to a member of the House, and I have to look at it in that context.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** I have talked this issue over---not this Bill specifically---with people in my electorate, more particularly the people in my electorate---

**Trevor Mallard:** Do it; refer to it once.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** He has been at it again. Can I say that I have spoken with members of my electorate---and particularly small and medium businesses within my own electorate---and they tell me that the legislation that is trying to be amended---

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** Order!

**An Hon. Member:** Stay out of it.

**The TEMPORARY SPEAKER (Peter Hilt):** I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. Interjections have been made, and I choose to ignore the one that has just been made. I say to honourable members that this is Parliament.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** The vast majority of workers and their employers say to me that they do not really want to see the return of what we had before in respect of industrial relations and of what the other day they termed: "The Wellington-based sort of middle-man approach". [Interruption] That was the word they used. I am sure they meant men and women, or whoever was in charge in Wellington. Whoever they were, men or women, used to come up to them and say: "You're going on strike today? Thank you. Stay out; we'll let you know when you can start again. We'll go back to Wellington where we carry on getting paid, but you can miss out on your own money."

In the vast majority of cases these employees and their employers appear to be working much more as a team unit in respect of what benefits them. They do not need the "big brother" union boss, who is usually miles away, stuffing up this new and very exciting productive piece of legislation that is helping New Zealand's economy now.

As members know, this particular amendment seeks to change the Employment Contracts Act that was introduced just a short time ago, back in 1991. The main objective of that Act is well worth recording, because it is working. The Act was to improve, if one likes, the adaptability and the flexibility of different businesses and their workforce to better match their surroundings.

In my opinion the Act set out to allow---and, in fact, is showing that it allows and encourages---both employees and employers to make up their minds and to make their choices---choices that are relevant to their particular organisations. This is very difficult for a large union-based organisation to 
be able to achieve. The Act saw the end of registered awards and agreements that were universal in their approach. So these rigid awards that did not really allow for individual input into the working environment came to an end.

At that time there was a need---and there still is---for the flexibility the legislation brought about in order that employers and workers spoke to each other directly, which they are doing.

**Lianne Dalziel:** Give us an example; name where workers are much better off than they were before.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** In almost every small business one would wish to visit in my electorate there will be a group of workers and their employers working together.

**Lianne Dalziel:** Name one.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** I can find the odd example, as the member did. If the current law does not help to overcome the disgraceful situation described by that employer, we have to find a way of doing it. I have to say that I am somewhat surprised---

**Lianne Dalziel:** They don't come to see the Minister, because there's no point.

**Hon. ROGER McCLAY:** Can the member stop squawking? It is just amazing. She has changed her seat, but she has also changed her mind because a number of her colleagues were on the select committee inquiry into this legislation. The present Leader of the Opposition was part of that inquiry. The member for Avon and the member for Island Bay were also on that particular inquiry. The report of that inquiry on the operation of the Employment Contracts Act was completed in September and reviewed and approved by all the members of the Labour committee, including the Opposition members.

In recent years commentators have been saying such things as: "Unemployment would have undoubtedly been worse if not for this particular Act. In fact, it has probably had more impact on the unemployment problem than any other of the Government's measures, including the more visible employment schemes." It is a very successful Act. I do not pick up the vibes that other members seem to be picking up in respect of workers in New Zealand, which say: "This has got to go." I guess we certainly do move in very different circles.

But I have to say that the Labour Party is being outdone by the Alliance at the moment in its endeavours to win back that wholehearted unswerving support of the union movement. The Alliance has got the movement tied up. The only problem is that there are not helluva a lot of unions any more, because the vast majority of the union movement were not the "biggies" the unionists were worried about, but the workers.

**SANDRA LEE (Auckland Central):** Alliance members would like to state again for the record in this debate that their first preference remains the repeal of the Employment Contracts Act. That is the policy position of the Alliance, and we are committed to it. But we also recognise, given there are only two Alliance members at present in the House, and given the position of this Government in terms of the Employment Contracts Act, that that is not possible. That is why this evening we have chosen to introduce this Bill.

We believe that this Bill is an important means of redressing some balance in our industrial relations legislation back in favour once more of the ordinary working people of this country. Tonight is a historic occasion because the Bill is also a significant reminder that this Parliament is also at the crossroads between the old electoral system and MMP. The people of this country are watching very closely tonight to see how this Parliament responds to their wishes on this issue. They have made their position clear throughout New Zealand in terms of the Employment Contracts Act.

The Government's imposition of that Act has undeniably caused tremendous hardship for working people and their families by systematically undermining their working conditions and rights throughout New Zealand. It has had the effect of being a major contributing factor to the massive growing gap between the rich and the poor in New Zealand. It has undermined all previous commitments to pay equity in this country. That is why we now see, as we recently celebrated International Working Women's Week, women in the workforce being forced to earn 20 percent less than their male counterparts for work of an equal nature.

The standard of living for families, as confirmed just yesterday before a select committee in this Parliament by a leading economist, confirms that there has been a significant fall of 17 percent in the median household income. There is then the issue of the casualisation of work, and the jobs and employment available, along with the travesty of the minimum youth rates that exist in this country.

Just a couple of days ago many of the young people involved with the youth law project in this country came to my office with a petition. The petition made the point that young people are being sent a clear message by employers that they are legally discriminated against, with the sanction of this Government through the Employment Contracts Act and minimum youth rates, which are applied solely by virtue of age rather than by virtue of any contribution in the workforce. I will be bringing that petition before this Parliament.

This Parliament sat here last year and waxed lyrical about the tragedy of our youth suicide rate and what we should do about it. But I have to tell the House that when we tell the young people of this country that their work is valueless and that we will pay them little or nothing, we send them a very clear message indeed. They are getting that message, and you had better get that message, too, because they may well make us all redundant. I do not mean you, Mr Speaker.

This evening my colleague the member for Sydenham has discussed some of the direct effects at a personal level of the Employment Contracts Act on employees in the workforce. It is confirmed by organisations such as the Swedish Employers Federation, which reported again last year that New Zealand workers are now some of the lowest paid in the Western World. It is confirmed by the travesty and discrimination we see against our young people when the Government yesterday provided an increase of 7c an hour in the minimum youth pay rate. That is the equivalent of five jellybeans or two bus tickets a week. How are young people meant to live on $150 a week when the average rent is $144 a week? I would like to see Cabinet Ministers living on $6 a week. They tell us they cannot survive in accommodation worth anything less than $950 a week.

Then we have the effects of the polytechs, which a previous speaker referred to. I had the opportunity to visit one of those polytechs on the picket-line last year in Tauranga. I have to state the effects of the Employment Contracts Act. It is sending very humble people, who wear twinsets and pearls and who have never picketed or protested in their lives, to the picket-line. It has also had the effect, because it has rendered workers vulnerable, of putting meatworkers alongside farmers, shoulder to shoulder, protesting against the Government and its ill-founded legislation that does not include only the Employment Contracts Act.

Tonight this Parliament has an opportunity, through this Bill at least, to repeal the worst aspects of the Act. We can amend the most punitive provisions of this Draconian legislation. I would like the opportunity just to go through some of the clauses that I believe will be significant.

Clause 14 provides that new employees, full-time or part-time, shall have an automatic right to terms and conditions of employment that are not inconsistent with those in an existing collective contract if they are doing work of the same nature as that done by employees covered by the collective contract. 
At the moment, we are aware that employers can put new employees on a different individual contract, and that serves to undermine and depress the collective contract entered into with current staff.

Clause 9 seeks to establish authority to represent. It shall be sufficient for a union to give an employer a list of names that the employees working for that employer have authorised to represent them. This is a provision in the Act as it is currently written that is being used quite deliberately by employers to frustrate any negotiating processes, and it ought to be done away with.

There is a provision within our Bill to enshrine in legislation the decision of the Employment Court in relation to partial lockouts. The case referred to earlier was the Society for the Intellectually Handicapped case before the Employment Court.

I would like to quote what the court said because I think it is significant. It is one of the reasons that it ought to be enshrined in statute. The court said: "There is no difference in principle between paying the employees less than they are due and paying them nothing at all or a nominal amount whilst still requiring work to be done." Here is the significant section, and it would be quite nice if some of these Ministers who have so much faith in this Act would listen to this. They should at least listen to the words of their own court: "This would consign employees in New Zealand into a position scarcely superior to serfdom."

That is the effect of the Employment Contracts Act, according to the Employment Court. The Alliance private member's Bill this evening enshrines that decision of the Employment Court in statute to prevent the partial lockout, and to enshrine it in law.

Under clause 10 the right of access for prospective bargaining agents will be improved. Employers will no longer be able to deny right of access, as we heard earlier this evening, for the purpose of obstructing employees' access to or choice of representation. Under clause 11, the right of access to authorised representatives will extend to all matters arising out of or in the course of employment, including, in the case of employee organisations, discussion of the business of the employee organisation.

Many other provisions are in the Bill, and I have heard this evening from some members on one side of the House that they feel it may be merely tinkering. I put it to those present this evening that it is far from that, but it is not enough. The Alliance recognises that, and is committed to the repeal of the Act. If the member for Hastings wants to introduce legislation to repeal the Employment Contracts Act, he can rely on Alliance support on that matter.

I have one more matter to raise this evening. There has been tenacious debate on this issue this evening. I urge Labour Opposition members not to grant the Government pairs on this issue. It does make a difference. When their private member's Bill on this issue was introduced, it was lost by two votes. Three Labour members were paired. They were the member for St Kilda, the member who has now formed a new political party, and the member for Tamaki. We do not have to do that this evening. We can respect the wishes of the people. We can allow MMP in this Parliament to reign. We have an opportunity, as did the member who introduced the Bill that evening said in this House, to embrace a new era and a new system.

Do not give the Government pairs on this issue, because it is a private member's Bill. It will not bring down the Government; it will remind them only that ultimately Parliament should reign and respect the wishes of the people. That is what this Bill does. The people of this country do not want this legislation. It never had a mandate, and it never will.

**IAN REVELL (Birkenhead):** The Alliance's policy on pairs is simply incomprehensible. It would have Government by stealth. It would have an Executive that could not carry out the business of Government outside Wellington, and it would be a matter of pot luck as to who could turn up in the House on the day to vote, as to whether the Government's programme could continue, as to whether the private sector could rely on what this Parliament was going to do. The last speaker, the member for Auckland Central, has given a very, very good example as to why the public of this country ought not to vote Alliance, and the very reason, I am certain, as to why they are going down "the gurgler" in terms of their public support even as we speak. I am sure that is not only to do with the mantle of leader changing to the member for Auckland Central.

I would like to turn to the very best reason for retaining the Employment Contracts Act in its entirety, exactly as it is today. I have heard speaker after speaker from the Opposition claiming that the Employment Contracts Act has reduced wages, forced down employees' conditions, put them all in the poor house, and all the other nonsense that one hears from a party desperate to get its hands on the trade union coffers---or what is left of the trade unions---without having to go out and honestly knock on doors for it as the National Party does.

Let me give a very firm example as to why this House supports the Employment Contracts Act and why the people of New Zealand support it. The average weekly earnings in the last 12 months---this is the latest Statistics New Zealand quarterly employment survey, November 1994---increased by 3 percent to $605.89. That is the largest annual increase since May 1992. Let me repeat that. In the 12 months to November 1994 there was a 3 percent increase in total weekly earnings of all employees--
-the largest increase since May 1992.

Ordinary time and overtime weekly earnings---let us deal with ordinary time weekly earnings in case the Labour Party thinks there has been some mix of the figures---increased by 2.9 percent. So total earnings were up by 3 percent and ordinary time earnings were up by 2.9 percent. What is the evidence that the Employment Contracts Act has forced down wages and conditions? It is a nonsense. It is a desperate plea by the Labour Party to rekindle union support to try to get the union out of the Alliance Party and back into the Labour Party. Members of the Labour Party remember fondly the days when the union cheques used to arrive in response to the Labour Party manifesto promising the largesse of the union movement to Labour. That is not so today, and what we are seeing here is a desperate attempt to rekindle that support.

I would like to refer the House to a survey that was carried out quite recently, in terms of the Employment Contracts Act, by the Department of Labour---the second Heylen survey about the Employment Contracts Act. This survey covered enterprises employing 320,000 people, so it is statistically quite accurate.

I invite the leader of the Alliance to listen to some of the results of that survey about the Employment Contracts Act, which this House and the people of New Zealand would like to hear. I invite her to listen to these facts and figures because she might learn something and change her mind about her opposition to the Employment Contracts Act.

That survey indicates clearly the following: 75 percent of all employees have negotiated contracts, 77 percent of those covered by an employment contract believe their conditions are now more relevant to their workplace, and 79 percent of employees in the private sector are satisfied with their contracts. Only 15 percent of workers surveyed want to abolish the Act. So what is the mandate amongst the people of New Zealand to significantly repeal or alter this Act? What is the mandate? The 
Department of Labour, which is an independent entity, surveyed 320,000 people and stated that only 15 percent of employees want to repeal the Act.

Let us have a look at stoppages before the Employment Contracts Act was introduced---wages lost; days lost---and after the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act. Let us refer to the official figures for the 1990 year---the last full year before the Employment Contracts Act was introduced---in which 330,923 working-days were lost. The average number of days lost per employee was 6.6 days. The estimated loss of wages and salaries was $48 million. That is $48 million lost by the intransigence of unions hauling people out of their workplaces, with half of them not understanding what they were striking for, all for relativity issues, union power issues, and nonsense issues that were not related to the interests of the workers at all.

Let us look at the 1993 year, which is the last year that appears in these figures: 23,000 working-
days were lost compared with 330,000 working-days, and the total of wages and salaries lost in the 1993 year was $2.8 million compared with $48 million. Who is winning under the Employment Contracts Act? I suggest that the employees---the workers of New Zealand---are the big winners in this situation, and most of them have recognised that now as they vote with their feet to leave their unions, which have sheltered them from the real world. The unions, in many cases, kept employees and employers apart from even discussing conditions and the effect of increases and wage bargaining.

When the Employment Contracts Act was reviewed by the select committee, the select committee heard example after example of how the Employment Contracts Act had brought the parties together by taking out the third party---which had not the slightest interest in maintaining that workforce and the viability of that business or enterprise---and forcing the parties to speak to each other, actually to talk to each other, about their working conditions, about how the factory should be run, about how the roster should be organised, and about how pay should be spread. Getting the parties actually talking has changed things dramatically in the workplace.

The genie is now out of the bottle and neither the Labour Party nor the Alliance will ever be able to force the genie back into the bottle, because the groups that have been empowered by this Act are the workers---the employees of New Zealand. They are the people who are now in control of their own destiny. They are the people who appoint their own bargaining agent today and decide whether they will have a bargaining session with their employer and on what issues. They no longer have to call upon the only union allowed to deal with their workplace to do so. They have a free choice.

Many have decided to stay with their union and this House respects that choice, and will continue to legislate for that to be the case. But many, many more have voted with their feet. Pre - Employment Contracts Act, pre-1991, somewhere between 50 percent and 55 percent of employees were covered, in some way or other, by unions, although that figure is disputed by the Employers Federation, which believes it was far less. Today, it is estimated that less than 20 percent of employees are now formally covered by a trade union and are represented by a trade union in their bargaining negotiations.

The member for Avon may well yawn. He is very lucky that he is in this House now and not in his old trade union job. If he was, he probably would not have a job, because the employees who were in his union have voted with their feet against the intransigence of their union and have departed, and are now bargaining for themselves in their workplaces. Long may that continue.

New Zealanders, today, know a great deal more about industrial relations and what a good employment contract is than they have ever done in the past. There are many examples that I would love to share with this House and, in the time I have left, I will share the example of the Tiwai Point smelter---a heavily unionised plant where there were 15-plus unions. It was heavily demarcated and 
there were lines around every form of work. There were strikes if one worker dared to change a belt on a machine---that on paper had to be done by an electrician. They would rather have the 4 1/2 hours' call out, and the double time on the weekend that was not necessary for a man to come out from home to do a job.

I will tell the House what has happened in that workplace. Of its own volition it has moved to individual contracts. There are no demarcation disputes any more. Every worker performs the tasks he is skilled to do, works far fewer hours than under the old union arrangements, and is earning the same or better money. That workplace will not have the union back and does not want the Labour Party.

**Hon. Dr MICHAEL CULLEN (St Kilda):** Briefly, I just want to say that this Act is going to change within 2 years anyway, so the National Party had better start thinking about what input it wants to have into that process of change.

I rise briefly to make one clear statement on behalf of the Labour Opposition: we have granted five pairs this evening. One of those is for the member for Kaimai, who is extremely seriously ill and whose life would be threatened by a return to Parliament at this stage. A pair is granted to the Minister of Finance, who has a serious viral illness, and pairs are also granted for three members who are overseas---namely, the Prime Minister who is doing his "Mr Smith goes to Washington" act, the Minister of Agriculture who is overseas at a major international conference representing New Zealand in respect of our largest export industry, and the member for Matakana, who is overseas at a parliamentary conference.

All three of those members would not be overseas without the granting of a pair by Labour; they would be here---present, and voting. I would resign from the Labour Party if we broke our word and withdrew pairs for people once they were safely on the plane and heading overseas. If the member for Auckland Central thinks that that is a basis for good-faith bargaining then I might just gently reconsider my support for this Bill.

**JIM ANDERTON (Sydenham):** I am touched that the Labour Party feels so strongly about keeping its word to the National Party. It is a pity that it did not feel so strongly about keeping its word to the people of New Zealand. It made a lot of promises to the people and it broke all of them, but it cannot break any promise to the National Party. [Interruption] Well, I am sure that people in the workplaces will be interested.

I heard the leader of the Labour Party say today that the Prime Minister had no specific message to take to Mr Clinton. She quoted that in the House. So the Prime Minister is off to take no specific message to Mr Clinton. He is away in Washington, DC, but here in New Zealand, in this Parliament, there is an Employment Contracts Act that can be overturned if the Labour Opposition withdraws its pairs---and we just heard that it does not intend to do so.

I want to say a word or two about pairs in this environment. I believe that pairs on private members' Bills have no place in this Parliament. If members want pairs on any other measure then they should argue for that, but they should not argue that pairs have any place on private members' Bills.

Let us get the facts straight. A private member's Bill introduced in this House goes to a select committee. Who has the majority membership on the select committee? It is the National Party.

**John Carter:** That's not true.

**JIM ANDERTON:** Well, they are parliamentary select committees. Why then does the Government insist on having a majority on most of them?

**John Carter:** The member knows that it doesn't.

**JIM ANDERTON:** Of course it does, because it wants to control the legislation. [Interruption] It controls it, anyway, so we are even frightened to do that.

Pairs under MMP will be a total anachronism, because if the Labour Party thinks about it for any more than 5 seconds it will remember that it said it wanted to be a minority Government in this House under MMP. That is what the Leader of the Labour Party wants. If a minority Government grants pairs and operates under pairs it is entrenching its minority. It is saying: "We'll be a minority and we'll actually give you pairs to ensure that we stay a minority." It will never try to win majority support in Parliament. It is simply ludicrous.

I want to deal with a few of the points that were raised tonight. The Government avoided detailing and speaking about any of the specifics of the Bill at all. It avoided answering the abuses that my colleague and I outlined in our speeches. The Government brought up extraneous issues---important, no doubt, like personal grievance procedures and compulsory unionism---that our Bill does not address. So it did not address the Bill; it addressed other things that it thought might be easier to attack.

Government members have claimed that the Employment Contracts Act is central to economic recovery. Well, I wonder why, then, so many other countries in the world do not have such legislation. Why do they not? There are plenty of countries that have a good recovery going on. They do not even have an Act like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act. The Australian economy has the same level of employment and the same level of inflation, but it does not have an Employment Contracts Act or an Act like our Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act.

The Employment Contracts Act is a recipe for low-wage growth. It is actually a form of subsidy to employers. It enables employers to exploit cheap labour and that is why it is not good for ordinary working people. But, of course, it is good for some employers. It encourages low productivity, and it encourages low economic activity. It does not encourage high productive activity, because it cuts wages and conditions and it is an easy way to make a profit. One does not need brains or innovation to act like Romano Pizza and refuse workers any increase in pay, keep them locked into the company's kind of contract, and refuse to deal with them at all. And that is called high productivity and economic activity---get real!

That kind of thinking matches the intellectual contribution of Government members tonight, which is about as appalling as one can get. I want to suggest to some individual members who contributed-
--such as the Minister of Labour, who said that freedom of association was upheld by the Employment Contracts Act---that that will come as a surprise to all those workers in the places that I have talked about, such as the meat processing units, McDonald's, Romano Pizza, and all the rest of them. They do not have any freedom of association. Their choice of union agents has been ignored by the workplace.

I heard the Minister of Labour say that half the workforce was not given rights previously. I can only presume that he thinks that half the workforce are employers. Are they really? Well, that will come as a surprise to employers. If we registered all the employers on one side and all the workforce on the other we would not have 50 percent on both sides. It is simply a ludicrous argument. When it was suggested that there was no right to a collective contract under the Employment Contracts Act I heard 
the Minister of Police say: "Neither should there be." That is where the National Party stands---exactly where the Minister of Police stands.

We raised a number of issues. When we said that employers were getting around the law, the answer from the Minister of Labour was: "That's what always happens, because people try to get around the law." If employers are taking advantage of the opportunities under the Employment Contracts Act it is because the Employment Contracts Act does not protect employee rights properly. That is why employers can do that, and it points to a fault in the Act. The Minister of Labour said that in an open economy one cannot force employers to enter multi-employer contracts. Why is the Government, therefore, trying to force the New Zealand Educational Institute and the Post Primary Teachers Association into joint negotiations on pay rates? That is what the Government is trying to do. The Prime Minister is leading the charge. The Government says: "We can't have multi-employer contracts." but the Government at the moment is involved in a tripartite manner in exactly that way. It is a double standard.

The member for Palmerston North said that a major reservation about the Bill from the Alliance was its failure to repeal the Employment Contracts Act. Well, I did not see any detail in the Labour Party's Bill about all the clauses it was going to repeal. All I saw was a Bill that stated we would go to a select committee and have a talk under a tripartite arrangement---which, in fact, the employers and the Government would be part of. If the Labour Party wants to put up legislation that shows in detail how it will repeal the Act, then let us have it. We will support that legislation. We will give that guarantee now. But we did not see any such legislation. The reservation is political posturing.

There was nothing in the Bill from the member for Palmerston North. We produced detailed clauses, and Labour Opposition members say they have reservations. They have reservations about detailed clauses; we are not supposed to have reservations about anything, which is what we had. The member for Tarawera avoided talking about practically anything in the Bill from the Alliance. I can only say---
and I hope that it is parliamentary---that the contribution from the member for Tarawera was vacuous rubbish. That is not as bad as some of the other language that is used, I admit, but his contribution was vacuous rubbish.

The situation is that the Employment Contracts Act is claimed by National Party members to be a cornerstone of the economic recovery. It has lowered wages for tens of thousands of workers. The gap between the rich and poor in New Zealand, and between those who own the assets and wealth of New Zealand and those who work to try to earn sufficient money for their families for their health care, education, housing, and so on is opening up at an exponential rate. The gap is opening between on the one side the majority of people, who are those who work for a living in terms of wages and salaries, and on the other side those who own production or who are managers in an elite sense.

The Employment Contracts Act, with significant levels of unemployment at its back, is a major contribution to the extension of that gap---the gap that is there, and which is present between the rich and the poor in any society. But in New Zealand the gap is becoming worse than in most other countries in the world in terms of its rate of expansion. International analyses that have been done on this matter prove that over and over again.

Government members are saying that this is the position they want to see continue. They want to see those who are put at a disadvantage by legislation such as the Employment Contracts Act continue to be placed at a disadvantage, and the Alliance---supported by members of the Labour Party and, I hope, our colleagues in other third parties---is saying no to that, just as the majority of New Zealanders say no to that. It will not be long before there is a majority Parliament that imposes that kind of will--

-the will of the people in this place---to bring about that change. I urge the Government to jump before it is pushed.
