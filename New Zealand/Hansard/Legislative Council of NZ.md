Under the above designation a Society has been formed, in connexion with the New Zealand Land Company, and consisting exclusively of heads of families and others, intending to settle permanently in New Zealand on lands purchased from the Company.

The object of this society is to promote co-operation in the numerous measures of preparation requisite for establishing a prosperous settlement.

The Society already numbers a considerable body of gentlemen, who have determined to emigrate with their families and property. Others, who may entertain similar views, are invited to join them. Qualification of a member of the Society, the purchase of 100 acres of land; of a member of the committee, 500 acres; including, in both cases, part of the first town. The greater part of the purchase money to be expended by the Company on the emigration of the purchasers, their families and servants. Members admitted by ballot only.

The Colony will depart in a body during August next, so as to reach their destination about Midsummer (in the southern hemisphere), when the site of the first town will have been determined and prepared for their reception by a preliminary expedition now on its way to New Zealand.

The Committee meets daily at the offices of the New Zealand Land Company, No. 1 Adam Street, Adelphi, where further information may be obtained on application (if by letter, post paid) to the Chairman of the society.

## Address from the Committee of Colonists
Saturday, 18 April 1840

The President and Council of the Colony take this opportunity of calling the attention of the Colonists to two documents published in this day's "Gazette"—one, the agreement or contract of government, signed in London by the majority of the Emigrants; and the other, a ratification of that agreement, subject to certain modifications, by the Sovereign Chiefs of the district.

The first and most important duty of the Council, upon their re-assembling in the Colony, was to take measures for the preservation of order and the maintenance of law. Although they had witnessed with much satisfaction the peaceful and orderly demeanour of nearly the whole of the Colonists, yet there had been some disorders which required an exercise of authority, and some differences which needed an appeal to a court of law. To secure the person and property of each inhabitant of the Colony against violence, and to establish a court of law for the adjustment of conflicting claims, were matters which admitted of no unnecessary delay. Besides these first and most pressing duties, many other points of deep interest to the Colony required early attention. It was needful to devise and give effect to measures which, by means of the combined powers of the community, might overconme the obstacles to civilization, arising out of the very circumstances of an infant colony;— to provide for the construction of roads and other public works useful to the whole community, and therefore to be constructed by general contributions;— to frame regulations adapted to unforseen or temporary exigencies;— in short, to give, to the Colonists laws and institutions suited to their new position. In doing this, it behoved the Council to weigh carefully the nature and extent of their powers, and where these appeared imperfect or inadequate, to take the proper measures to render them complete and effectual.

The Council therefore proceeded to consider the situation of the Colonists, in relation to the question of Sovereignty. Although willing to admit in the fullest extent the power and the right of the English Government to exercise Sovereignty within the Islands of New Zealand, whenever it may please the Legislature of England to assert that right, yet it appeared to the Council, that under the recent proclamations of the Governor of New South Wales, the English Government had formally disclaimed the existence of any right of Sovereignty in the Crown of England, and had in the amplest manner recognised the independent Sovereignty of the Native Chiefs of the Island. As that proclamation contains a reference to the acquisition by purchase of the sovereign rights of the Chiefs, the Council believe and hope, that, ere long, the authority of the English Crown will be established in this place. That authority does not, however, exist at the present moment. On the contrary, the Government of England has recognised every petty tribe in New Zealand as an independent foreign power, and has by implication asserted the right of the Chiefs to exercise authority over every person residing within their territories, according to the laws, or rather customs, of the tribe. Every act of Government therefore within the Colony, whether legislative or executive, must derive its validity from the assent, express or implied, of the principal Chiefs of the district. And every act of government thus sanctioned, must be recognised as valid by the Government of England and every civilized Government.

The Council being satisfied of the correctness of this view, deemed it their first duty to obtain from the Chiefs of this district, a ratification of the contract of government, signed in England by the Colonists. And as that contract was of necessity incomplete, inasmuch as its framers were unable to foresee the precise circumstances in which the Colonists would be placed in New Zealand, it was needful that the ratification should enlarge and modify the powers conferred by the original instrument. It further appeared incumbent upon the Council to secure to the Colonists the enjoyment of the laws of England, and that self-government by means of representatives chosen by the people, which is the birthright of every Englishman. So that whenever Great Britain shall acknowledge this Colony as one of its depencies, there may be nothing which requires alteration; and in the mean time the Colonists may enjoy the laws to which they have been accustomed, and the liberties to which as Englishmen they are entitled, and may provide by their representatives for the peace, order, and prosperity of the community.

In the modifications introduced into the original contract of government, the Council have endeavoured to secure the responsibility of the Government to the body of the Colonists, by making the Council subject to re-election at an early period; to secure to the Natives fair and equal treatment, by investing them with the same rights as the other inhabitants of the Colony, with the single exception of the right of voting at elections,— which has been deferred for a period sufficiently long to fit them for its exercise; to guard against any improper use of the Sovereignty recognised by the English Government as existing in the Chiefs, either from ignorance or from the incitement of designing or turbulent Europeans, by providing that they shall not perform any act of Sovereignty except through the instrumentality of the Council; and to obtain for the Colonists the amplest powers of administering their own affairs, by investing the President and the Council with full legislative and executive powers.

To the proposed ratification, the principal Chiefs of the district have given their fullest assent, and it now consequently forms the law of the Colony. It will remain such at least until this Colony shall be united with the British Empire; and the Council trust that even then it will continue to exist, subject only to the necessary alterations which such an union would involve. The Council, therefore, in submitting it to the Colony, confidently rely upon the concurrence and support of the Colonists. It has always been the boast of Englishmen, that their habits of obedience to the law, and respect for the rights of others, qualify them for the enjoyment of free institutions. Those habits have been, with very few exceptions, signally displayed in the short period that has elapsed since the foundation of the Colony, and the Council doubt not that they will continue to be manifested.

By order of the Council,
SAMUEL REVANS,
Secretary.

# Committee of Colonists
Saturday, 18 April 1840

Saturday, April 4, 1840.

A dispatch of 13th Setember, 1839, from the Board of Directors of the New Zealand Land Company was read. Its purporse was placing at the disposal of Colonel Wakeneld, £2000 for urgent purposes; the necessity for this expenditure to be shown by the endorsation of the drafts, for all or any part of it, of not less than three members of the Committe. This contingent fund was evidently suggested under the idea that some few months must elapse before taxation would meet the the expences of the Government of the colony. After the dispatch was read it was resolved:—

"..That Col. Wakefield, the Chief Agent of the New Zealand Land Company, be authorized to draw upon the Company for the sum of £1000, and that Messrs. Hanson, Hopper, and Hunter be requested to endorse the bills."

Dr. Evans and Mr. Hanson were then deputed to prepare an Address to the Colonists, to appear with the Constitution derived from the Chiefs of Port Nicholson.

Col. Wakefield having urged upon the Committee of Colonists the immediate necessity of his being provided with a Police Force, it was resolved:—

"That the President of the Committee be authorised to take such steps as he may find necessary for the establishment of a sufficient Constabulary Force; and that this Committee pledges itself to provide the funds for the payment of the same."

It was then resolved that the Committee should meet every Saturday, at 2'clock p.m. and that unless a quorum be present by half-past 2 o'clock, that the meeting adjourn for the day. For the present, the meetings are to be held at the private house of the President, who kindly placed his residence at the disposal of the Committee, for that purpose.

Saturday, April 11, 1840.

The Committee met.

Col. Wakefield stated that he had formed a Constabulory Force, to consist of a magistrate, two district constables,— one to reside at this end of the Bay, and the other at Thorndon,— each to have two petty constables subject to his control. That the expense of this portion of the establishment would amount to about £10 per week; and that the salary to be allowed the magistrate remained to be determined hereafter.

It was then resolved—

"That the magistrates and constables appointed by the President of the Committee shall respectively possess and exercise in this Colony all the powers which in England belong to the office of a justice of the peace and consthbles, so far as the same are applicable to this Colony."

Mr. Hanson and Dr. Evans submitted a draft of the Address which at the last meeting they were requested to prepare.

It was accepted, and ordered to be published in the forthcoming number of the "New Zealand Gazette." The thanks of the Committee were then voted to those gentlemen, for the able manner in which they had performed their task.

Upon the notices of motions given by Mr. Molesworth, that he would propose Mr. Hort, and by Mr. Hopper, that he would propose Mr. Barton to fill the vacancy occasioned by the retirement of Capt. W. M. Smith, R.A., being read,—

It was moved by Mr. H. Moreing, seconded by Mr. R. D. Hanson, that the election be postponed to this day three months. For, 4; against, 7; — majority, 3.

It was then moved by Mr. F. A. Molesworth, seconded by Mr. D: Sinclair, that Mr. A. Hort be elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the retirement of Captain W. M. Smith, R.A., which was carried unanimously.

After the notice had been read, it was moved by Mr. George Duppa, seconded by the Hon. Henry Petre, that Mr. R. D. Hanson be elected Vice-President. Carried unanimously.

The Committee then adjourned.

## Meeting of the Council
Saturday, 25 April 1840.

Saturday, April 18, 1840.

Dr. Evans asked if some arrangement could be made, for a public building, to serve as a Police Court, Town Hall, &c.

The President replied, that he was in treaty with Mr. Moreing for a building to be devoted to those purposes.

Dr. Evans stated that he had not been able yet to prepare a set of rules, to submit to the Council, for the future conduct of their business.

The President called the attention of the Council to the expediency of affording compensation for growing crops, and other outlays to lease-holders under the New Zealand Land Company, when the land shall be surveyed and open for selection, under the regulations of the Company.

Saturday, 2 May 1840

Saturday, April 25, 1840.

The sitting of the Council was occupied in discussing a bill for the more effectual provision for the due administration of justice within this district, than is contained in the agreement or contract prepared in England, and since extended and ratified by the Chiefs of Port Nicholson.

## Meeting of the Council

Saturday, May 9, 1840.

Mr. Moreing brought forward his motion and the Council, after discussing the subject resolved:—

"That, in order to encourage the cultivation of land and the production of food in the Colony, and to facilitate the granting of leases for those purposes, by the Company's Chief Agent, before the land sections be surveyed and allotted, all holders of land orders from the New Zealand Land Company, entering according to the order of choice, on possession of land leased by the Company, shall pay compensation to the leaseholders for growing crops, agreeably to the conditions of the leases granted by the Company's Agent, or allow a reasonable time for the removal of crops."

## Meeting of the Council

Saturday, May 23, 1840.

Owing to the stormy weather on the 16th, there was not a quorum, and the Council adjourned.

On the 23rd, several motions were entered, and a discussion arose on the mode of employing those who should be sentenced to hard labour. It was urged that it would be well to use such labour for a particular purpose— public improvement of some kind. It was considered that there are two public works, which ought to be completed as soon as possible, and which it might be well to have done by prison labour;— making a road from the bend of the valley to Thorndon, by which both sides of the harbour would then have a good land communication; and cutting the canal which is to be formed in the town, upon a scale sufficient to admit a large class of boats, but the discussion did not result in any determination.

A letter from Mr. Robert Tod, lately from Australia, was then read.

The Secretary was ordered to prepare a reply, to the effect that the members of the Council had not the knowledge which he asserted they possessed; and that his conduct did not entitle any unsupported charges he might make to the slightest degree of credit.

The Council then adjourned.

## Public Notice

By order of Colonel William Wakefield, President of the Council, acting under the authority of the Sovereign Chiefs of the District of Port Nicholson.

Whereas, by Articles the first and thirteenth, of the Agreement signed by the majority of the Colonists before leaving England, and to which th eforce of law hath been given by Sanction and Ratification of the Sovereign Chiefs of this District, it is provided:—

1st.— That all the persons parties to this Agreement, shall submit themselves to be mustered and drilled under the directions of persons to be appointed as hereinafter mentioned. And

13th.— That the Company's Principal Agent shall have the highest authority in directing the armed inhabitants, when called out; and that the Committe shall have the power to appoint such other persons as they think fit to assist in such direction.

Notice is hereby given, that measures will be immediately taken for carrying into effect the foregoing Articles of Agreement, and that all the male inhabtants of the District, between the ages of eighteen and sixty, will be henceforward required to hold themselves in eradiness to be mustered and drilled under the direction of the President of the Council.

As it is intended to occupy no more than one hour in each week in this muster of the armed inhabitants, the object of which is to assure the minds of all persons of the existence of an adequate force for the preservation of of order, it is believed that all who feel interested in the protection of life and property, as well as in upholding the power and authority of the British race, will make it a point of honor to attend and answer to their names, when called upon the muster-roll, with such arms as they may be in the possession of: and it is expected that the employers will make no deduction from the wages of those employed by them, for the small portion of time that may be taken from the day's labour for the discharge of an important public duty.

By the order of the President of the Council,
SAMUEL REVANS, Secretary.

## Meeting of the Council

Saturday, May 30, 1840.

Mr. Hunter proposed the postponement of Mr. Moreing's motion, until the next meeting of the Council.

The Secretary's letter to Mr. R. Tod was amended and passed. The following is a copy:—

                         "Council, May 28, 1840.
Sir,— In reply to your letter, dated 21st
May, I am instructed by the President and
Council to state, that your appeal ought to
have reached the Council in the mode pre-
scribed by the Agreement signed by a large
body of Colonists in London, and since ren-
dered binding on all persons inhabiting Port
Nicholson, by having been extended and
ratified by the Sovereign Chiefs of this dis-
trict; that the members of Council are not
in possession of the knowledge you un-
hesitatingly assert them to possess; that your
conduct does not entitle any unsupported
charges you may make to the slightest credit;
that your artful efforts to produce a rupture
between the native and European population
at Thorndon, which might have been produc-
tive of the worst consequences, furnish grounds
for your being pointed out to the police as a
dangeorus character, and raise the question in
the mind of every person interested in the pros-
perity of the settlement, whether you are en-
titled to the fellowship of your countrymen.
                       (By order) SAMUAL REVANS;
                                      Secretary.
Mr. Robert Tod, of Australia."

After discussing the subject of calling on the armed inhabitants,

Mr. Molesworth proposed, seconded by Mr. Hort:—"That full powers be given to Colonial Wakefield to effect such arrangements as he may consider requisite for calling out a protective force of the armed inhabitants of Port Nicholson."
