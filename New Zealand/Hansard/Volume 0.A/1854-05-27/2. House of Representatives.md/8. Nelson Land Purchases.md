# NELSON LAND PURCHASES.

**Mr. PICARD** moved for a return of lands purchased in the Province of Nelson, in conformity with the Proclamation of the 4th March, 1853. As the question of waste lands was to be brought before the House, he wished the House to be in possession of every information respecting his own province. He had learned, indirectly, that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the returns wished for.

**Mr. REVANS** was sorry the honourable member had obtained private informationâ€”that he had used back-stair influence. The House must come to the point respecting Responsible Government. They must have parties and responsible officers, or the House would not get through its business for the next six months. He was appalled by the amount of business he saw before him. He hoped gentlemen would not tell the House they had private information. He wished for no information but that which came directly and legitimately through this House.

Motion agreed to.
