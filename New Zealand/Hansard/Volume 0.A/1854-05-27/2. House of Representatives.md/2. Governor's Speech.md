# GOVERNOR'S SPEECH.

**Mr. SPEAKER** reported that, when the House attended upon His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government in the Legislative Council Chamber, His Excellency was pleased to deliver a Speech to both Houses of Parliament, of which he had, for greater accuracy, obtained a copy.

On the motion of **Mr. REVANS**, it was ordered, That the copy of His Excellency's Speech be laid on the table.

**Mr. SPEAKER** stated that, owing to the insufficiency of clerical assistance, the Clerk had not been able to bring up the minutes of their past proceedings, but on Monday it was hoped that the minutes would be in a fit state to be submitted for confirmation. He also stated that, until Standing Orders were prepared and adopted, it would be for the convenience of the House if honourable members who had petitions to present would do so immediately after the chair was taken, and that notices of motion should be given before the House proceeded to the Orders of the Day.
