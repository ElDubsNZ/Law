# NOTICES OF MOTION.

Mr. HART wished to be allowed, as the House was not under the restriction of standing rules, to place on the notices for this day a notice of motion for a return of correspondence on the subject of the erection of a lighthouse at Port Nicholson; and also a notice that he would move for returns showing the amount of additional Customs duty derived from spirits since the increased rate of tariff came into force. It was because of the steamer being<!--15--> about to sail for the southern settlements before the House met again that he made this request; and, for the same reason, he would beg that the notices which stood in his name for Wednesday should be allowed to take place on the Notice Paper for this day.

Mr. REVANS would second the request, but trusted that this case of emergency would not be taken to establish a precedent.

Agreed to.
