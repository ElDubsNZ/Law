# SELECT COMMITTEE

**The Hon. Mr. WHITAKER** moved the appointment for the session of a Committee, to be called "the Standing Orders Committee," whose duty it should be to prepare rules for the management of the business of the Council, and for such conferences and communications with a Committee of the House of Representatives as might be necessary: the Committee to consist of the Hon. the Speaker, the Hon. Mr. St. Hill, the Hon. Mr. Dillon Bell, the Hon. Mr. Seymour, and the Hon. Mr. Whitaker.

**The Hon. Mr. GILFILLAN** seconded the motion.

**The Hon. Mr. DILLON BELL** objected to the transaction of any business then, as he did not conceive that the Council was duly constituted until the Assembly had been formally opened by the Officer Administering the Government.

After a very brief discussion,

**The Hon. the SPEAKER** said that, being appealed to, he must decide that it was quite competent for the Council to take the proposed step, inasmuch as the 52nd clause of the Constitution Act required that the Council should proceed to the formation of rules, &c., at their first sitting.

Motion agreed to.

The Council then adjourned until three o'clock.

The Hon. the SPEAKER took the chair at three o'clock p.m.

There being no business before the Council, the Council then adjourned until Saturday at two o'clock p.m.
