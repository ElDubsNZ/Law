That the Standing Orders Committee consist of the Speaker, Messrs. Bartley, Sewell, Carleton, E. J. Wakefield, Macandrew, King, Dr. Monro, and the mover.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** suggested, as an addition, that after the words "each other" the following words be inserted: "That, until the report of the said Committee be received, it shall be a Standing Order that Mr. Speaker do regulate the proceedings of the House."
