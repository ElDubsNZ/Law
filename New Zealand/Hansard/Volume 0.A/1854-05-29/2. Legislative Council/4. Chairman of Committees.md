# CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES.

The Hon. Mr. DILLON BELL moved, That the Hon. Major Richmond be permanent Chairman of Committees of the Council. He thought it was not desirable that the Speaker, who presided over the whole proceedings, should also be Chairman of Committees. In Committee the discussions assumed a different form, and it was the duty of the Chairman of Committees to report to the Speaker. On the whole he considered it expedient that a Chairman should be appointed, and he believed that, except the Speaker himself, there was no member better fitted for the office than Major Richmond.

The Hon. Mr. SEYMOUR seconded the motion.

The Hon. the SPEAKER reminded the Council that they had just agreed to adopt temporarily certain rules and orders, one of which provided that the Speaker should be Chairman of Committees . He suggested, for the consideration of the honourable member, whether it might not be better to postpone his motion until after the Standing Orders were finally revised and adopted.

The Hon. Mr. DILLON BELL concurred in the course suggested; and the motion was withdrawn for the present.
