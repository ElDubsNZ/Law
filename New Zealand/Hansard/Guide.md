# Call of the Speaker

A member who is said to "Have the call of the speaker", i.e. the Speaker of the House has called upon them to make a speech will have their name in bold.

**John Smith (Electorate):**

An interjecter, or member with a point of order, or anyone else without the call of the Speaker will have their name in bold *and* italics.

***An Hon. Member:***

The Speaker's name is always just bold, as they always have the right to Speak.

**The Speaker:**

This is different from regular Hansard where the MP with the call of the Speaker will be identified in all caps.
JOHN SMITH (Electorate):

However this is not as easily parsable in a digital format as two or three asterisks in a row.

# Votes

In regular Hansard, votes are listed by listing the surnames of MPs (and adding initials after the name if removing ambiguity is required). e.g. Ayes 3 Smith Allan J Peters

To make parsing easier, names have been separated by commas, and a colon where names begin. e.g. Ayes 3: Smith, Allan J, Peters
