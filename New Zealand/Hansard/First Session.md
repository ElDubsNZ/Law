# Legislative Council

Wednesday, 24th May, 1854
Opening of Parliament—Appointment of Speaker—Select Committee.

## Opening of Parliament

Pursuant to the Proclamation of His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government, Parliament met on the 24th day of May, 1854, at twelve o'clock noon, for the despatch of business.

The Legislative Council being met,
William Martin, Esq., Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, a Commissioner appointed by *dedimus potestatem* for administering the oath to the members, did adminster the oath to the members who appeared; which being done, and the members having subscribed the oath, they took their seats in the Council.

## Appointment of Speaker

**The Hon. the SPEAKER** (William Swainson, Esq., Attorney-General) then addressed the Council. He said that many of the members were no doubt already aware that His Excellency the Officer Adminstering the Government had been pleased to appoint him (Mr. Swainson) to fill the office of first Speaker of the Legislative Council of the General Assembly of New Zealand. But it might be proper that, before proceeding to take the chair, he should read and lay before the Council the Commission authorizing him to assume and exercise the duties of the office. [The Speaker here read the Commission, and then continued:] He believed it was an ancient usage for the Speaker of the greatest legislative Assembly in the world, on the occasion of his appointment to office, humbly to represent his incapacity for so great a trust. Having been appointed to the highest and most honourable office which it was in the power of Her Majesty's representative in New Zealand to bestow, he could assure the Council that he had not ventured to undertake its duties without some diffidence, or without a full sense of his need for their considerate indulgence. But, having been selected to fill that distinguished office, and having accepted the appointment, he could assure the Council that he would feel it not only his duty, but his own pride and pleasure, to discharge its requirements in such a manner as might tend to justify the choice, to uphold the character of that Council, and to promote the interests of the colony at large. In exercising his duties, it might no doubt happen that he should express opinions and give decisions in which the Council might not be able to concur. But he would pray that, however much they might deem him to be in error as to judgment, they would believe him to be at all times influenced by a sincere desire faithfully, impartially, and to the best of his ability to discharge the duties of the office.

**The Hon. the SPEAKER** then read the Proclamation calling the meeting of the General Assembly.

## Select Committee

**The Hon. Mr. WHITAKER** moved the appointment for the session of a Committee, to be called "the Standing Orders Committee," whose duty it should be to prepare rules for the management of the business of the Council, and for such conferences and communications with a Committee of the House of Representatives as might be necessary: the Committee to consist of the Hon. the Speaker, the Hon. Mr. St. Hill, the Hon. Mr. Dillon Bell, the Hon. Mr. Seymour, and the Hon. Mr. Whitaker.

**The Hon. Mr. GILFILLAN** seconded the motion.

**The Hon. Mr. DILLON BELL** objected to the transaction of any business then, as he did not conceive that the Council was duly constituted until the Assembly had been formally opened by the Officer Administering the Government.

After a very brief discussion,

**The Hon. the SPEAKER** said that, being appealed to, he must decide that it was quite competent for the Council to take the proposed step, inasmuch as the 52nd clause of the Constitution Act required that the Council should proceed to the formation of rules, &c., at their first sitting.

Motion agreed to.

The Council then adjourned until three o'clock.

The Hon. the Speaker took the chair at three o'clock p.m.

There being no business before the Council, the Council then adjourned until Saturday at two o'clock p.m.

# House of Representatives

Wednesday, 24th May, 1854

Opening of Parliament

## Opening of Parliament

The House met at twelve o'clock noon.

Mr. Carleton took the chair.

William Martin, Esq., Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, a Commissioner appointed by *dedimus potestatem* for administering the oath to members, did administer the oath to members who appeared; which being done, and the members having subscribed the oath, they took their seats in the House.

On the motion of Mr. RHODES, seconded by Mr. CUTTEN, the following resolution was adopted: "That a deputation from this meeting of the members of the House of Representatives do wait on His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government, for the purpose of respectfully representing to His Excellency the hope of the members that it may suit the convenience of His Excellency to postpone, until Friday next, the opening of the General Assembly. The deputation to consist of Messrs. Cutten, Greenwood, Porter, Bartley, Clifford, O'Neill, and the mover."

The deputation, having waited upon His Excellency, stated, on their return, that His Excellency had been pleased to say that, whenever it should be announced to him that the House had elected its Speaker, he would be prepared to open the Assembly and deliver his Address.

**Mr. CARLETON** then delcared the meeting dissolved, and left the chair.

On the motion of Mr. REVANS, seconded by Dr. LEE, Mr. Carleton resumed the chair.

**The CHAIRMAN** then read the Proclamation summoning the General Assembly.

**Mr. REVANS** moved, That the House do now proceed to the election of a Speaker.

**Mr. RHODES** seconded the motion.

**Mr. MACANDREW** moved, That the House do adjourn until Friday next at eleven o'clock, then to meet for the election of a Speaker.

**Mr. MERRIMAN** seconded the amendment.

**Mr. O'NEILL** urged an immediate election of a Speaker.

**Mr. FORSAITH** argued that by such a course, after having asked His Excellency to assent to a postponement, the House would stultify itself.

Amendment agreed to.

The House accordingly adjourned.

# House of Representatives

Friday, 26th May, 1854

Election of Speaker—Messages—Resignation of Seat—Prayers at Opening—Standing Orders—Resignation of Seats—Clerk of House

The House met at eleven o'clock a.m.

On the motion of Mr. O'NEILL, seconded by Mr. REVANS, Mr. Carleton was called upon to preside.

Mr. Carleton took the chair.

## Election of Speaker

**The CHAIRMAN** read the 8th clause of the Constitution Act, which requires that the House at its first meeting shall proceed to elect a Speaker.

**Mr. BARTLEY** rose and said he had much pleasure in proposing for the honourable office of Speaker of that House a gentleman who was known to each and to all the members; a gentleman of high standing and station, who possessed much property in the colony, and was strongly bound to it by every tie of honour and of interest; one who was not unaccustomed to the duties of the office, and who possessed also that kindness of manner which, next to impartiality, was the highest qualification for the office, as tending to harmonize and promote proper feeling among the members; one who, in all other respects, he was sure teh House would consider highly qualified for the responsible and honourable post. He had therefore much pleasure in proposing Charles Clifford, Esq., to be their Speaker, being confident that, if elected, he would fulfil the duties of the office with impartiality, grace, and dignity.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** felt that he could with much satisfaction second the motion which had just been proposed to the House. He believed that the office would be honourably and impartially filled by Mr. Clifford. In the absence of precedent to guide gentlemen in the exercise of duties to which few may have turned their attention, it would be an advantage to the House to have one in the chair who had had some experience in conducting, in another province, business of a similar character to that which would occupy the House. And, besides, he believed that the love which Mr. Clifford entertained for the institutions under which they had met would influence him in conducting the deliberations of that House so as to reflect credit on the country to which he was so strongly attached.

The motion was put from the Chair, and carried unanimously.

**Mr. GIBBON WAKEFIELD** said that, in the absence of a more ready means of communicating with the Officer Administering the Government, so as to know His Excellency's pelasure as to confirming the election which they had just made, he believed it would be proper that a deputation, consisting of the mover and seconder, and such other members as teh House might think proper, should wait on His Excellency to acquaint him of the choice they had made. From what had come to his knowledge he thought the House woudl best consult the convenience of His Excellency by appointing the deputation, who would receive His Excellency's decision at twelve o'clock on the next day, which would not look so conspicuously incondiserate as if it were given immediately; and afterwards, at two o'clock, His Excellency's Opening Address would be dleivered.

**Dr. LEE** thought that, as the Speaker had been duly elected by the House, it became now the duty of the proposer and seconder to conduct the Speaker to the chair.

**Mr. CUTTEN** thought that, until confirmed by the Governor, as provided by the Act under which they were assembled, the election of the Speaker was not complete, and therefore it would be out of order to proceed as suggested by the honourable member who spoke last.

**Dr. MONRO** thought it desirable that as little time as possible should be lost before communicating with His Excellency, as there had occurred two vacancies in the representation of Nelson, which required to be reported to the Officer Administering the Government, but must in the first instance be reported to the Speaker after his being duly appointed. It was desirable that the writs should be issued in time to be sent down by the steamer, so that Nelson might have its full representation in that House as soon as practicable.

**Mr. GIBBON WAKEFIELD** said he made the suggestion after a chance conversation with the Attorney-General, who had stated that the course pointed out by him (Mr. Wakefield) was that which would best accord with the arrangements of His Excellency. He would regret that any delay should take place with respect to the Nelson elections, and might say that he understood the writs were quite ready to be signed as soon as the House had reported the vacancies.

**Dr. LEE** maintained that enough had been doen to entitle the Speaker to take the chair, and quoted precedents taken from the proceedings of the Legislative Council of New South Wales and the House of Commons in support of his views.

**Mr. MACANDREW** and MR. **FITZGERALD** thought that, according to the Constitution Act, Mr. Clifford could not be properly considered the Speaker of that House until his appointment had been approved by the Governor.

**Mr. MERRIMAN** concurred in this view, and observed that there was no real difficulty, inasmuch as they had a Chairman.

**Mr. CLIFFORD** said that, whatever might be the order in which the House might carry out its decision, he could no longer refrain from expressing his thanks for the very courteous manner in which he had been proposed, and for the unanimity with which the House had chosen him. He could assure the House that he felt deeply gratified in placing his services at the disposal of the House.

**Dr. LEE** reiterated the expression of his views, and declared that the Governor had no theoretical right to reject anything that had passed that House.

**Major GREENWOOD** said he was aware that His Excellency would be at his office at twelve o'clock to receive any deputation that might be appointed to wait on him.

**Mr. REVANS** could see no reason why Mr. Clifford should not take the chair, for, if he was not indeed Speaker, he was at least Speaker-elect. He would therefore move, That the present Chairman do leave the chair, and that Mr. Clifford be conducted to the chair.

The motion was carried; whereupon

**Mr. CARLETON** rose and said,—Mr. Clifford, I have much pleasure in leaving the chair, and in congratulating you, as well as this House, on your appointment.

Mr. Speaker then took the chair.

It was then proposed and agreed that Messrs. Bartley and FitzGerald should be the deputation to wait on His Excellency to inform him that the choice of the House had fallen on Mr. Clifford.

**Mr. FORSAITH** said that, if they desired to follow out the analogy of the House of Commons in their proceedings, the next step would be the appointment of a Serjeant-at-Arms.

After some remarks by several members, who considered the House not yet properly constituted, this subject was allowed to drop.

On the motion of **Mr. REVANS**, seconded by **Mr. FORSAITH**, a vote of thanks to Mr. Carleton for his manner of conducting the business as preliminary Chariman was passed unanimously.

The House then adjourned until one o'clock.

The House reassembled at one o'clock.

## Messages

The Clerk announced a message from His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government; whereupon His Excellency's Private Secretary was introduced, and presented to Mr. Speaker Messages No. 1 and No. 2, as under:—

### Message No. 1.

                                "Government House,
                         Auckland, May 26th, 1854.
The Officer Administering the Government
has had much pelasure in confirming the
choice made by the House of Representatives
of Charles Clifford, Esq., to be the first Speaker
of the said House.
                                    R. H. Wynyard"

After reading this message, Mr. SPEAKER said taht he could not refrain from again thanking the House for the high honour conferred on him. He was sure he might rely on receiving their full support in conducting the business of the House, as well as in maintaining its rights and privileges.

### Message No. 2.

                           "Government House,
                    Auckland, May 26th, 1854.
The Officer Administering the Government
proposes to address teh members of the As-
sembly, on the occasion of the opening of the
session, at the Council Chamber, on Saturday,
the 27th instant, at two o'clock p.m.
                              R. H. Wynyard."

## Resignation of Seat

Mr. Speaker announced that he had receive dnotice of the resignation of Mr. Cautley, as member for the Waimea District.

## Prayers at opening

**Mr. MACANDREW** suggested that, before the House proceeded to any further business, there should be an acknowledgment of dependence on the Divine Being, and that prayers should be made for a blessing on their labours; and if, as he understood, the feeling of the House was in favour of that course, he would, with their permission, withdraw to invite the nerest clergyman, who, he believed, was the minister of the parish, to officiate.

**Mr. REVANS** thought it had better come in the shape of a motion before the House.

**Mr. SPEAKER** remarked that, as a rule, it would be desirable, to prevent mistakes, if members would put their motions in writing and hand them to the Clerk.

**Mr. MACANDREW** had not prepared any formal motion on the subject, believing that it had only to be mentioned to be adopted by the House, and feeling assured that every right-thinking man would consider it fit and proper that the first act of the House of Representatives should be an acknowledgment of the Divine favour to this country, and of supplication for a continuance of that favour upon which their prosperity so materially depended. However, if it was the wish of the House, he had no objection to bring the subject formally before it, and would now move, That it is fit and proper that the first act of the House of Representatives shall be a public acknowledgment of the Divine Being, and a public supplication for His favour on its future labours.

The motion was seconded by Mr. MACKAY.

**Dr. LEE** said that the question was one which, to his mind, admitted of no discussion, and he would therefore move, That the House of Representatives be not converted into a conventicle, and that prayers be not offered up.

**Mr. REVANS** seconded the amendment.

**Mr. CARLETON** trusted that no discussion would arise on this question: such would be, indeed, irrelevant, inasmuch as he had no doubt every member had come to that House with his mind fully made up, and was therefore ready to vote either one way or the other.

**Mr. O'NEILL** felt as deeply as any other member could possibly feel his obligation to the Divine Being whose providence had brought him to this fine country; but, at the same time, he could not agree to the introduction of any particular minister of religion to offer up prayers in that House, composed, as it was, of members holding religious views so widely differing from each other. He should be very sorry to see in that chamber a minister of the Church to which he belonged engaged in a service which would be as unacceptable to them as it would be to himself if ministers of their Churches were called on to officiate. He therefore could not support the motion. The cause of religion was more likely to be retarded than furthered by the adoption of it. He thought, however, it was premature for the House to discuss the subject; it would be competent for the Officer Administering the Government to introduce his chaplain at the opening of the General Assembly, when no doubt he would do so, and prayers would be offered. Afterwards, the question should more properly come before the House as to whether it should be one of their standing rules that prayers should be used.

**Mr. FORSAITH** did not think that the House should avoid discussion of this question: it was one of great moment, and would present itself to them in various forms. He had looked forward tot he introduction of the subject after the opening of the General Assembly, and was prepared to give it his support, for there was no reason why members of the House, who were the representatives of a people acknowledging the Almighty Being, should refrain from seeking from Him who was the source of all good that aid which he trusted, as individuals, they invoked.

**Mr. MACANDREW** had no objection to allow the motion to stand over until after the opening of the Assembly, if that was the general wish of the House.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** could not understand that the opening of the General Assembly had anything to do with the question. If it were the intention to press it on the House, it might as well be decided now.

It was suggested by a member that Mr. Macandrew might postpone the further consideration of his motion until after the opening of the General Assembly, as the withdrawal of it nowwith that understanding would only be a withdrawal on form, not on principle.

**Mr. MACANDREW** said that, to his mind, whatever course should be taken with regard to this subject at the opening of the General Assembly, it was clear to him that the House of Representatives, being the first embodiment of a New Zealand nationality, should be consecrated; and with this view he had called the attention of the House to the subject before proceeding to any business.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** was not willing to give a silent vote on this occasion, lest he might be misunderstood. He did not think the amendment was one that ought to have been proposed in its present form to the House, as it was not worded in language, to say the least, of courtesy and respect; but at the same time, he must withhold his support from the original motion, because it seemed to involve the question of a State religion, the very appearance of which ought to be avoided by that House. He did not wish that his opposition to the motion should be misunderstood. He had been one of those who, in the province to which he belonged, had spared no pains to provide for the due observance of religious ordinances according to those forms which he believed to be right; but in doing so it was with no wish to establish a State Church, but one that should be maintained by the voluntary support of those who enjoyed its privileges. The Constitution had raised no hindrance to colonists of the Hebrew faith or Unitarians sitting as members of that House; and surely, if Jews and Unitarians were the majority of its members, and the nearest Church of England clergyman were to be brought in to perform divine service, the service would be but a monstrous mockery; and, again, if conducted according to their views, he himself, and no doubt other members, would feel obliged to leave the room. It might be easy to open up the door to admit difficulties, but not so easy to get rid of the practice altogether as absurd. At Canterbury, at the opening of the Provincial Council, he had suggested what he believed to be the proper way to avoid the difficulty—that members of the Church of England should attend at a service in the parish church before the opening of the Council; and such was the mode they adopted to seek the Divine blessing—a course which he believed to be the most rational one for each to take in his own way, rather than attempt to call upon all to agree to any one mode or form for the occasion.

**Mr. GLEDHILL** could not agree to the amendment as it stood, which might convey the impression that there was some great attempt made in the House to establish conventicles. At the same time, he thought th eHouse should keep to its own business, for, if there was not a full appearance of a State-Church tendency in the movement, there was certainly an approach to it: he thought it better, therefore, to steer clear of it altogether, and let the House at once turn its attention to its legitimate duteis.

**Dr. MUNRO** could not see any occasion to fear the setting-up of one Church above another by the House agreeing to invoke the Divine aid at the commencement of its duties. For his own part, he was willing to join in the prayers of any Church offered up for such an object.

**Mr. GIBBON WAKEFIELD** said the dread entertained by some members of a State Church being set up if the House engaged in prayer was, he thought, entirely unnecessary, for in countries where State religion is absolutely repudiated the invariable practice is to open the Legislative Houses by prayer. He was quite sure, with respect to America, that both Houses of Congress prayer was used, sometimes by a minister of one denomination adn sometimes by another.

After some further remarks from members on both sides, at the suggestion of several members, Dr. Lee withdrew his amendmetn; when

**Mr. WELD** thought the discussion was likely to be fruitlessly prolonged without any definite result; and, to bring the question to an issue, he would, now that the former amendment had been withdrawn, beg to submit the following: That this House, whilst fully recognizing the improtance of religious observances, will not commit itself to any act which may tend to subvert that perfect religious equality that is recognized by our Constitution, and therefore cannot consistently open this House with public prayer. The only remark he thought it desirable to make was that he objected ot the introduction of any practice into that House by which religious equality was not recognized. Hebrew gentlemen might be elected, and therefore it would be impossible to frame a form of prayer suitable to them and to Christians also, without involving the House in debate on abstruse religious points which were not fitting themes for discussion in that House, and not calculated to encourage sincere reglious conviction.

**The Hon. J. STUART-WORTLEY** seconded the amendment, because he thought the course proposed by the motion must of necessity lead to a State-Church discussion, and to all the unpleasantness of the factious opposition which is usually given to it. They should avoid the insertion of the wedge, lest they might be unable to draw it out again.

**Mr. CUTTEN** could not see any connection between the opening of that House by prayer and the establishment of a State Church.

**Mr. REVANS** could hardly take as a fact what had been stated by the honourable member for the Hutt with respect to the practice in America. At any rate, if it were as he described, it surely was an evidence of great religious laxity when they admitted minsters of all creeds to officiate, turn and turn about. He thought the motion would lead the House away in a retrograde direction from the free spirit of the Constitution, which appeared to have been framed so as that the colonists of New Zealand at any rate should be exempt from the causes of heartburning on religious questions which, being interwoven in the old institutions at Home, could not be so readily got rid of. No man had a right to prescribe him in what manner he should worship his God; for what was no matter of doubt as between man and hi Maker was too often the source of much discord as between man and man; and, as no man could assist or prevent his fellow-man in his relation to God, then none should seek to prescribe to him the manner of worshipping that Being. There could be no doubt that by the adoption of the motion the House must attach some form of religion or another to the State; and then the question must arise by-and-by, What form is it to be?

**Mr. FORSAITH** was sorry to find that in this discussion there was a disposition to confound things which had no affinity whatever. The question lay at the very root of religion itself, and was not merely one of the form or mode of carrying it out. He could not understand that, if the House was determined to open its proceedings with prayer, therefore it had declared in favour of a State Church. This he would as firmly oppose as any man; but he could not oppose what he believed to belong to the very groundwork of our common faith. He was not aware that there were any Jews in that House; but, even if there were, he was sure they would not object to offer up prayer and supplication to Jehovah. When the Jew assembled in his synagogue, he was accustomed to read out his Scriptures, "In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths;" and according to this injunction did not refrain from seeking that direction. There could be no objection to the members of that House, in their collective capacity, having recourse to that which he trusted in their individual capacity they observed; but especially was it incumbent on them, who had been made the honoured instruments of introducing a new and liberal system of government into this great country, to acknowledge their dependence on the Divine wisdom, and to seek guidance and assistance of the Supreme Being. He thought that by doing so the House would act upon a sound policy, and without interfering with any man's religious rights.

**Mr. GIBBON WAKEFIELD** said, with regard to what had fallen from the honourable member for Wairarapa respecting what he (Mr. Wakefield) had stated of America, he could not say as a fact that prayers were read or said in all the Legislative Assemblies throughout the Union, but that he believed such was the case. With respect to the New England States he could speak positively, and he believed he might safely say so also of the others. Laxity in religion had been referred to, but the fact was that in no country was there a greater manifestation of deep religious sentiment and principle than in America. And, to show their great regard for religious equality, he might mention that some years ago a proposal was made, in order to secure a better observance of the Sabbath, that the mails should be stopped on that day. That this met with acceptance among a people remarkable for their strict Sabbath observance was not surprising; and the law was about to be passed, when one said that, to make it complete and equal, the law should extend also to the Jews' Sabbath—that the rule should be absolute on the Saturday as well as on the Sunday; and, lest there should be any appearance of inequality, the measure was abandoned altogether. And yet, in that country, the practice sought to be established here, and opposed on the ground of its being an infringement of relgious rights—this practice was, he believed, everywhere observed. He should have been glad to have avoided further discussion on this subject; he did not profess to claim for himself the high religious feeling which he sincerely believed guided the life of his honourable friend the mover of the resolution; but he should be sorry, for the sake of decency, that New Zealand should be singular in this respect among the Christian countries of the earth. That which was sought for here was observed by England and Holland, Protestant countries; by Belgium and Sardinia, Catholic countries; and he might go on to mention many others. He did not therefore wish that New Zealand should be the exception to what was considered everywhere decent and good to be observed.

**Dr. LEE** was at a loss to know how it would be possible for his honourable colelague for the Northern Division to frame forms of relgious ceremony in which the Jew and the Christian could unite. He thought, as the Constitution had very properly rid them of State religion, the House shoudl take care how they voluntarily submitted to it.

Several other members briefly addressed the House.

The House divided on the question, "That Mr. Weld's amendment be agreed to."

Ayes, 10.

Crompton    Lee         Stuart-Wortley

Majority against, 10.

The amendment was consequently negatived.

Whereupon the original motion was put to and carried.

**Mr. FORSAITH** moved, and **Mr. CUTTEN** seconded, That, in proceeding to carry out the resolution of the House to open its proceedings with prayer, the House distinctly asserts the privilege of a perfect poltiical equality in all religious denominations, and that, whoever may be called upon to perform this duty for the House, it is not thereby intended to confer or admit any pre-eminence to that Church or religious body to which he may belong.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** moved, as an amendement, That this House adjourn until tomorrow at two o'clock.

**Mr. O'NEILL** seconded the amendment.

Amendment put, and negatived.

The original motion was then put, and carried.

The Rev. F. J. Lloyd, being in attendance, was introduced, and read prayers.

**Mr. SPEAKER** having thanked the Rev. F. J. Lloyd, in the name of the House, for his attendance, that gentleman withdrew.

## Standing Orders

**Mr. MERRIMAN** moved, That a Committee be appointed for the session, called "the Standing Orders Committee;" that it be the duty of that Committee to prepare such Standing Orders as they may from time to time deem advisable to be adopted by the House: that the Committee do report on the second day of June, and from time to time afterwards as they may see occasion or be required by teh House; that the Committee be authorized to communicate with any Committee appointed by the Legislative Council, with a view to the adoption of Standing Orders to regulate the mode in which the House and the Legislative Council shall confer, correspond, and communicate with each other. That the Standing Orders Committee consist of the Speaker, Messrs. Bartley, Sewell, carleton, E. J. Wakefield, Macandrew, King, Dr. Monro, and the mover.

**Mr. FITZGERALD** suggested, as an addition, that after the words "each other" the following words be inserted: "That, until the report of the said Committee be received, it shall be a Standing Order that Mr. Speaker do regulate the proceedings of the House."

Motion, thus amended, agreed to.

## RESIGNATION OF SEATS

**Mr. SPEAKER** read a letter from W. T. L. Travers, Esq., resigning bis seat as representative for the Town of Nelson.

**Dr. MONRO** moved, That this House address His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government, stating the existence of two vacancies, in consequence of the resignation of William Oldfied Cantley, Esq., late member for the Waimea District, and of William Thomas Locke Travers, Esq., late member for the Town of Nelson. That the Hon. the Speaker be requested to present the address to His Excellency the Officer Administering the Government.

**Mr. MACKAY** seconded the motion.

Motion agreed to.
